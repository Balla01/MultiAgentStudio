ICC Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees  
(URDG 758)  
 
 
 
Article 1 
Application Of URDG 
 
a) The Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees ("URDG") apply to any demand guarantee or 
counter-guarantee that expressly indicates it is subject to them.  They are binding on all parties 
to the demand guarantee or counter-guarantee except so far as the demand guarantee or 
counter-guarantee modifies or excludes them. 
 
 b) Where, at the request of the counter-guarantor, a demand guarantee is issued subject to the 
URDG, the counter-guarantee shall also be subject to the URDG, unless the counter-guarantee 
excludes the URDG.  However, a demand guarantee does not become subject to the URDG 
merely because the counter-guarantee is subject to the URDG. 
 
 c) Where, at the request or with the agreement of the instructing party, a demand guarantee or 
counter- guarantee is issued subject to the URDG, the instructing party is deemed to have 
accepted the rights and obligations expressly ascribed to it in these rules. 
 

d) Where a demand guarantee or counter-guarantee is issued on or after 1 July 2010 states that 
it is subject to the URDG without stating whether the 1992 version or the 2010 revision is to 
apply or indicating the publication number, the demand guarantee or counter- guarantee shall 
be subject to the URDG 2010 revision.

Article 3 
Interpretation 
 
In these rules: 
a) Branches of a guarantor in different countries are considered to be separate entities. 
 
 b) Except where the context otherwise requires, a guarantee includes a counter-guarantee and 
any amendment to either, a guarantor includes a counter- guarantor, and a beneficiary includes 
the party in whose favour a counter-guarantee is issued.  c) Any requirement for presentation of 
one or more originals or copies of an electronic document is satisfied by the presentation of one 
electronic document. 
 
 d) When used with a date or dates to determine the start, end or duration of any period, the 
terms: 
i.  "from", "to", "until", "till" and "between", include; 
and 
ii "before" and "after" 
 exclude, the date or dates mentioned. 
 
 e) The term "within", when used in connection with a period after a given date or event, excludes 
that date or the date of that event but includes the last date of that period. 
 
 f) Terms such as "first class", "well-known", "qualified", "independent", "official", "competent" 
or "local" when used to describe the issuer of a document allow any issuer except the beneficiary 
or the applicant to issue that document. 
 

Article 4 
Issue and effectiveness 
 
a) A guarantee is issued when it leaves the control of the guarantor. 
 b) A guarantee is irrevocable on issue even if it does not state this. 
 c) The beneficiary may present a demand from the time of issue of the guarantee or such later 
time or event as the guarantee provides. 
 
 Article 5 
independence of guarantee and counter-guarantee 
 
a) A guarantee is by its nature independent of the underlying relationship and the application, 
and the guarantor is in no way concerned with or bound by such relationship.  A reference in the 
guarantee to the underlying relationship for the purpose of identifying it does not change the 
independent nature of the guarantee.  The undertaking of a guarantor to pay under the 
www.cipcic-bragadin.com 
5 
guarantee is not subject to claims or defences arising from any relationship other than a 
relationship between the guarantor and the beneficiary. 
 
 b) A counter-guarantee is by its nature independent of the guarantee, the underlying 
relationship, the application and any other counter-guarantee to which it relates, and the 
counter-guarantor is in no way concerned with or bound by such relationship. 
A reference in the 
counter- guarantee to the underlying relationship for the purpose of identifying it does not 
change the independent nature of the counter-guarantee.  The undertaking of a counter-
guarantor to pay under the counter-guarantee is not subject to claims or defences arising from 
any relationship other than a relationship between the counter-guarantor and the guarantor or 
other counter- guarantor towhom the counter-guarantee is issued.  
 
 Article 6 
Documents v. goods, services or performance 
 
Guarantors deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the 
documents may relate. 
 
 Article 7 
Non-documentary conditions 
 
A guarantee should not contain a condition other than a date or the lapse of a period without 
specifying a document to indicate compliance with that condition.  If the guarantee does not 
specify any such document and the fulfillment of the condition cannot be determined from the 
guarantor's own records or from an index specified in the guarantee, then the guarantor will 
deem such condition as not stated and will disregard it except for the purpose of determining 
whether data that may appear in a document specified in and presented under the guarantee 
do not conflict with data in the guarantee. 
 

Article 8 
Content of instructions and guarantees

precise and should avoid excessive detail.

advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the guarantee as received by the advising 
party. 
 
 b. By advising a guarantee, the second advising party signifies to the beneficiary that it has

advising party elects nonetheless to advise that guarantee, it shall inform the beneficiary or 
second advising party that it has not been able to satisfy itself as to the apparent authenticity of

whenever possible use the same party to advise any amendment to that guarantee. 
 

Article 11 
Amendments 
 
a. Where, at the time of receipt of instructions for the issue of an amendment to the

an amendment of the guarantee at any time until it notifies its acceptance of the amendment 
or makes a presentation that complies only with the guarantee as amended. 
 
 d. An advising party shall without delay inform the party from which it has received the 
amendment of the beneficiary's notification of acceptance or rejection of that amendment. 
 

e. Partial acceptance of an amendment is not allowed and will be deemed to be notification of 
rejection of the amendment. 
 
 f. A provision in an amendment to the effect that the amendment shall take effect unless 
rejected within a certain time shall be disregarded

on the occurrence of a specified event which under the terms of the guarantee results in the 
variation of its amount, and for this purpose the event is deemed to have occurred only:

for that presentation.  If the guarantee does not so specify, a document may be presented in any 
electronic format that allows it to be authenticated or in paper form.  An electronic document 
that cannot be authenticated is deemed not to have been presented. 
 
 d. Where the guarantee indicates that a presentation is to be made in paper form through a 
particular mode of delivery but does not expressly exclude the use of another mode, the use of 
another mode by the presenter shall be effective if the presentation is received at the place and

indicated in article 20 shall start on the date of identification.  Nothing in this paragraph shall 
result in an extension of the guarantee or limit the requirement in article 15 (a) or (b) for any 
separately presented documents also to identify the demand to which they relate.

g. Except where the guarantee otherwise provides, documents issued by or on behalf of the

the demand. 
 
 c. The requirement for a supporting statement in paragraph (a) or (b) of this article applies

or otherwise prejudice the right to make another timely demand, whether or not the guarantee

bound by a payment made in such currency.

counterguarantee, the counter-guarantor, of the period of suspension of payment under the

instructions to that effect. 
 
 b. The guarantor assumes no liability or responsibility for errors in translation or interpretation

party's charges for carrying out its instructions. 
 
 b. If a guarantee states that charges are for the account of the beneficiary and those charges 
cannot be collected, the instructing party is liable to pay those charges.  If a counter-guarantee

charges cannot be collected, the counter- guarantor remains liable to the guarantor, and the 
instructing party to the counter-guarantor, to pay those charges.

Transfer of guarantee and assignment of proceeds 
 
a. A guarantee is transferable only if it specifically states it is "transferable", in which case it may 
be transferred more than once for the full amount available at the time of transfer.  A 
counterguarantee is not transferable. 
 
 b. Even if the guarantee specifically states that it is transferable, the guarantor is not obliged to 
give effect to a request to transfer that guarantee after its issue except to the extent and in the 
manner expressly consented to by the guarantor. 
 
 c. A transferable guarantee means a guarantee that may be made available by the guarantor to 
a new beneficiary ("transferee") at the request of the existing beneficiary ("transferor").  
 
 d. The following provisions apply to the transfer of a guarantee: 
 
i. a transferred guarantee shall include all amendments to which the transferor and guarantor 
have agreed as of the date of transfer; and 
ii. 
a guarantee can only be transferred where, in addition to the conditions stated in paragraphs 
(a), (b) and (d)(i) of this article, the transferor has provided a signed statement to the guarantor 
that the transferee has acquired the transferor's rights and obligations in the underlying 
relationship. 
 
 www.cipcic-bragadin.com 
18 
e. Unless otherwise agreed at the time of transfer, the transferor shall pay all charges incurred 
for the transfer. 
 
 f. Under a transferred guarantee, a demand and any supporting statement shall be signed by 
the transferee.  Unless the guarantee provides otherwise, the name and the signature of the 
transferee may be used in place of the name and the signature of the transferor in any other 
document. 
 
 g. Whether or not the guarantee states that it is transferable, and subject to the provisions of 
the applicable law: 
 
i. the beneficiary may assign any proceeds to which it may be or may become entitled under the 
guarantee; ii.  however, the guarantor shall not be obliged to pay an assignee of these proceeds 
unless the guarantor has agreed to do so.

the guarantor's branch or office that issued the guarantee.

location of the counter-guarantor's branch or office that issued the counter-guarantee. 
 
 Article 35

beneficiary relating to the guarantee shall be settled exclusively by the competent court of the  
country of the location of the guarantor's branch or office that issued the guarantee. 
 
 b. Unless otherwise provided in the counter-guarantee, any dispute between the counter-
guarantor and the guarantor relating to the counter-guarantee shall be settled exclusively by

MT 734 Advice of Refusal
MT 734 Scope
This message is sent by the issuing bank to the bank from which it has received documents related
to a documentary credit.  It may also be sent by the bank nominated to pay/accept/negotiate/incur a
deferred payment undertaking to the bank from which it has received documents.
 It is used to advise the Receiver that the Sender considers the documents, as they appear on their
face, not to be in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit and that, consequently, it
refuses them for the discrepancies stated.  The Sender also provides the Receiver with details
regarding the disposal of the documents.
 This message type may also be used for claiming a refund.
 The MT 734 is intended for refusal under commercial LCs and should not be used for refusal under
standby LCs/guarantees.

Credit
MT 760 Scope
This message is sent in one of three ways:
•
by the party that issues or advises the issue of an undertaking (demand guarantee or standby
letter of credit) to the beneficiary, when the beneficiary is a financial institution, or to the party
designated to advise the undertaking to the beneficiary or to another advising party
•
by the party that issues a counter-undertaking (counter-guarantee or counter-standby) to the
party that is requested to issue a local undertaking to the beneficiary, either directly or via an
advising party
•
by the party that issues a counter counter-undertaking (counter-guarantee or counter-standby)
to the party that is requested to issue another counter-undertaking to a party that is requested
to issue a local undertaking to the beneficiary, either directly or via an advising party
Unless otherwise specified, an independent undertaking issued or advised to the beneficiary or
advised to another advising bank based on a SWIFT message constitutes an operative instrument.

•
When the maximum message size of the MT 767 is insufficient, one or more MTs 775 can be
used to extend the available size.  Up to seven MTs 775 may be sent in addition to the MT 767.
 •
Information conveyed in a designated field in this message (for example, 32B Increase of
Undertaking Amount) must not be repeated in any related MT 775.  The information in any
related MT 775 must not conflict with any information that is present in this MT 767.
 •
Information conveyed in a designated field in the message should not be repeated or in conflict
with the terms and conditions specified in field 77U or with the requested local undertaking
terms and conditions specified in field 77L, in either the MT 767 or MT 775.
 •
Information in field 77U must not be in conflict with information that is conveyed in a designated
field elsewhere in this message.
 •
If the amendment relates to other elements than amount or expiry, these changes must be
mentioned in 77U or 77L.
 •
The terms and conditions of the original guarantee or instruction(s) that are not mentioned in
the message remain unchanged.

•
The cancellation of a guarantee, that is, MT 760, takes the form of an amendment.  The MT 767
must therefore be used.

Letters of Credit have been a cornerstone of
international trade dating back to the early
1900s. 
They continue to play a critical role in
world trade today.  For any company entering
the international market, Letters of Credit 
are an important payment mechanism which
help eliminate certain risks.
 Our purpose in publishing this guide is to
provide a basic understanding of Letters of
Credit from both the Importer’s and Exporter’s
points of view.  In addition, we hope that it will
serve as a handy reference tool as you use
Letters of Credit in your international trade
transactions.

Parties Involved 
in a Letter of Credit
The following definitions will assist in understanding a Letter of Credit
(L/C) transaction.
 Accepting Bank 
The bank named in a term (usance) Letter of Credit on which drafts are
drawn that has agreed to accept the draft.  By accepting the draft, the Drawee
Bank signifies its commitment to pay the face amount at maturity to anyone
who presents it at maturity.  After accepting the draft, the Drawee Bank
becomes the Accepting Bank.

Advising Bank 
The bank to which the Issuing Bank forwards the Letter of Credit with
instructions to notify the Exporter (Beneficiary).
 “available with” Bank 
The bank authorized in the Letter of Credit to effect payment under, accept or
negotiate the Letter of Credit.
 Confirming Bank 
The bank which, at the request of the Issuing Bank, adds its confirmation to
the Letter of Credit.  In doing so, the Confirming Bank undertakes to make
payment to the Exporter upon presentation of documents under the Letter of
Credit.
 Drawee Bank 
The bank named in the Letter of Credit on which the drafts are to be drawn.
 Exporter/Beneficiary/Seller
The party that has contracted to sell goods.
 Importer/Applicant/Buyer 
The party that has contracted to buy goods.
 Issuing Bank 
The bank issuing the Letter of Credit on behalf of the Importer (Buyer).
 Reimbursing Bank 
The bank designated in the Letter of Credit to reimburse the “available with”
Bank which submits payment claims under the Letter of Credit.
 Transferring Bank 
The bank authorized by the Issuing Bank to transfer all or part of the Letter
of Credit to another party at the Beneficiary’s request.
 A Letter of Credit, simply defined, is a written instrument issued by a bank 
at the request of its customer, the Importer (Buyer), whereby the bank
promises to pay the Exporter (Beneficiary) for goods or services, provided
that the Exporter presents all documents called for, exactly as stipulated in 
the Letter of Credit, and meet all other terms and conditions set out in the
Letter of Credit.  A Letter of Credit is also commonly referred to as a
Documentary Credit.
 There are two types of Letters of Credit: revocable and irrevocable.  A
revocable Letter of Credit can be revoked without the consent of the
Exporter, meaning that it may be cancelled or changed up to the time the
documents are presented. 
A revocable Letter of Credit affords the Exporter
little protection; therefore, it is rarely used.  An irrevocable Letter of Credit
cannot be cancelled or changed without the consent of all parties, including
the Exporter.  Unless otherwise stipulated, all Letters of Credit are irrevocable.
 A further differentiation is made between Letters of Credit, depending on the
payment terms.  If payment is to be made at the time documents are
presented, this is referred to as a sight Letter of Credit.  Alternatively, if
payment is to be made at a future fixed time from presentation of documents 
(e.g.  60 days after sight), this is referred to as a term, usance or deferred
payment Letter of Credit.
 The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) publishes internationally
agreed-upon rules, definitions and practices governing Letters of Credit, called
“Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits” (UCP).  The UCP
facilitates standardization of Letters of Credit among all banks in the world
that subscribe to it. 
These rules are updated from time to time; the last
revision became effective January 1, 1994, and is referred to as UCP 500.
 Copies of the UCP 500 are available from your TD branch or Global Trade
Finance office. 
Please refer to the back cover of this guide for a listing 
of these offices.

What is a Letter of Credit?
 5
The following is a step-by-step description of a typical Letter of
Credit transaction:
1.
 An Importer (Buyer) and Exporter (Seller) agree on a purchase and sale
of goods where payment is made by Letter of Credit.
 2.
 The Importer completes an application requesting its bank (Issuing
Bank) to issue a Letter of Credit in favour of the Exporter.  Note that the
Importer must have a line of credit with the Issuing Bank in order to
request that a Letter of Credit be issued.
 3.
 The Issuing Bank issues the Letter of Credit and sends it to the Advising
Bank by telecommunication or registered mail in accordance with the
Importer’s instructions.  A request may be included for the Advising
Bank to add its confirmation (See page 24 for more information on
Letter of Credit confirmation).  The Advising Bank is typically located in
the country where the Exporter carries on business and may be the
Exporter’s bank but it does not have be.  
 4.
 The Advising Bank will verify the Letter of Credit for authenticity and
send a copy to the Exporter.

5.
 The Exporter examines the Letter of Credit to ensure:
a) it corresponds to the terms and conditions in the purchase and 
sale agreement;
b) documents stipulated in the Letter of Credit can be produced; and
c) the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit may be fulfilled.

6.
 If the Exporter is unable to comply with any term or condition of the
Letter of Credit or if the Letter of Credit differs from the purchase and
sale agreement, the Exporter should immediately notify the Importer
and request an amendment to the Letter of Credit.
 7.
 When all parties agree to the amendments, they are incorporated into
the terms of the Letter of Credit and advised to the Exporter through
the Advising Bank.  It is recommended that the Exporter does not make
any shipments against the Letter of Credit until the required
amendments have been received.
 8.
 The Exporter arranges for shipment of the goods, prepares and/or
obtains the documents specified in the Letter of Credit and makes
demand under the Letter of Credit by presenting the documents within
the stated period and before the expiry date to the “available with” Bank.
 This may be the Advising/Confirming Bank.  That bank checks the
documents against the Letter of Credit and forwards them to the Issuing
Bank.  The drawing is negotiated, paid or accepted as the case may be.

9.
 The Issuing Bank examines the documents to ensure they comply with
the Letter of Credit terms and conditions.  The Issuing Bank obtains
payment from the Importer for payment already made to the “available
with” or the Confirming Bank.

A Guide to Letters of Credit

10.  Documents are delivered to the Importer to allow them to take
possession of the goods from the transport company.  The trade cycle 
is complete as the Importer has received its goods and the Exporter
has obtained payment.
 Note: In the diagram below, the Advising Bank is also acting as the
Confirming Bank.
 Payment Under a Letter of Credit
A key principle underlying Letters of Credit is that banks deal only in
documents and not in goods.  The decision to pay under a Letter of
Credit is entirely on whether the documents presented to the bank
appear on their face to be in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit.  It would be prohibitive for the
banks to physically check all merchandise shipped under Letters of
Credit to ensure merchandise has been shipped exactly as per each
Letter of Credit.  Accordingly, the integrity of both the Exporter and
Importer are very important in a Letter of Credit transaction. 
The
appropriate due diligence should be exercised by both parties.

Advantages to the Importer
•  Importer is assured that the Exporter will be paid only if all terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit have been met.
 •  Importer is able to negotiate more favourable trade terms with the Exporter
when payment by Letter of Credit is offered.
 Disadvantages to the Importer
•  A Letter of Credit does not offer protection to the Importer against the
Exporter shipping inferior quality goods and/or a lesser quantity of goods.
 Consequently, it is important that the Importer performs the appropriate
due diligence to assess the reputation of the Exporter.  If the Exporter acts
fraudulently, the only recourse available to the Importer is through legal
proceedings.
 Note:
Added protection to the Importer may be provided by
requesting additional documentation in the Letter of Credit,
e.g. 
a Certificate of Inspection.  Refer to Documents Section
(page 18).
 •  It is necessary for the Importer to have a line of credit with a bank before
the bank is able to issue a Letter of Credit.  The amount outstanding under
each Letter of Credit issued is applied against this line of credit from the
date of issuance until final payment.
 8
Advantages and Disadvantages 
of Using a Letter of Credit
9
Advantages to the Exporter
•  The risk of payment relies upon the creditworthiness of the Issuing Bank
and the political risk of the Issuing Bank’s domicile, and not the
creditworthiness of the Importer.
 •  Exporter agrees in advance to all requirements for payment under the
Letter of Credit.  If the Letter of Credit is not issued as agreed, the Exporter
is not obligated to ship against it.
 •  Exporter can further reduce foreign political and bank credit risk by
requesting confirmation of the Letter of Credit by a Canadian bank.
 Disadvantages to the Exporter
•  Documents must be prepared and presented in strict compliance with the
requirements stipulated in the Letter of Credit.

•  Some Importers may not be able to open Letters of Credit due to the lack of
credit facilities with their bank which consequently inhibits export growth.

general rule is to take the Latest Shipping Date (K) and add the
number of days the Exporter is allowed to present the
documents (Q). 
 Example: If the Latest Shipping Date is November 1 and 10 days are
allowed to present documents, then the Expiry Date of the 
L/C would be November 11.

Letters of Credit – 
Importer’s Perspective
11
D  Applicant.  Enter your company name and address exactly as it appears
on your line of credit.

E  Beneficiary. 
The name and address of the Exporter.

F  Issue By. 
This is the method by which we will send the Letter of Credit 
to the Advising Bank.  It may be sent at your option by mail or
teletransmission depending on the urgency of the situation.  For a small
cost, teletransmission enables your Letter of Credit to be received faster 
by the Beneficiary. 
This is the method most commonly used.

G  Currency and Amount. 
Enter the currency and maximum amount that
can be drawn under the Letter of Credit.
 Note:
Writing the words “about”, “approximately” or “circa” before
the amount indicates that the amount may vary up to +/- 10%.
 Variance is not restricted only to the percentages indicated
above; you may choose any other variances, e.g. 
+/- 15%.

Further information regarding variances is detailed under
Goods (M).
 H  Partial Shipments.  Check the appropriate box to indicate if you will allow
partial shipments to take place under the Letter of Credit.
 Transhipment.  Indicate whether or not transhipment is allowed.  Your
choice depends on the method of shipment/transport document used.
 Generally, transhipment means that, during the course of voyage,
merchandise is unloaded and reloaded from one vessel to another vessel
or from one mode of transportation to another.  Transhipment must be
allowed for multimodal and air transport documents.

Examples of Transhipment:
1.  A shipment is destined for the Philippines but there is no carrier available to
go directly to the Philippines.  It must first stop in Japan and be transferred to
another carrier destined for the Philippines. 

2. 
A shipment is destined to Calgary, Alberta from the port of Hong Kong. 
 First it travels by ocean carrier from Hong Kong to Vancouver, BC and then 
must be transferred onto a truck or rail destined for Calgary.

I
Transferable Credit.  Indicate if the Letter of Credit may be transferred to
another party.  For information regarding Transferable Letters of Credit, please
refer to Other Types of Letters of Credit (page 43).
 J  Available Against Documents Detailed Herein.
 A Beneficiary’s Draft.  The document that represents the demand for 
payment that the Exporter (Beneficiary) makes on the bank.  Generally, a
Beneficiary’s draft is required as evidence that a drawing has been made by
the Beneficiary on the Letter of Credit.
 The use of drafts is not common in all countries; sometimes a draft is 
avoided in view of the excise stamp duty that it attracts.  While this does 
not change anything in the case of sight payments under Letters of 
Credit, the situation is slightly different when a term payment is used. 

In this case, settlement is defined as a “Deferred Payment”.

At Sight. 
Payment is made upon presentation of stipulated documents. 
 This payment term is commonly used.
 __ Days After Sight or __ Days after Date of __: The Exporter may agree to
provide extended payment terms such as “payable 60 days after sight” or “30
days after Date of Bill of Lading”.  This is referred to as a term payment.  In this
case, payment will be made on the maturity date of the accepted draft.

K Shipment From. 
Name of the place/port from which the goods will be shipped.
 For Transportation To.  Name of the place/port to which the goods will 
be shipped. 
 A Guide to Letters of Credit
Not Earlier Than.  If specified, goods cannot be shipped earlier than this date. 
 Not Later Than.  The latest mutually acceptable date for the shipment to
be made. 
Commonly known as the “Latest Shipping Date”.

L  Insurance. 
Indicate whether you, the Applicant, or the Shipper (Exporter)
is responsible for insuring the goods.  Keep in mind that this must
coincide with the Trade Term (N).
 M Goods.  Enter a brief description of the merchandise.  The common practice
is to use a Purchase Order or Performa Invoice number.  Example: Men’s
shoes as per Purchase Order #23456.  Including excessive detail does not
give you more protection against inferior or defective goods shipped since,
as mentioned earlier, banks deal in documents and not in goods.
 Variances.  A variance of 5% more or 5% less will be allowed as long as:
a) the merchandise description is not stated in number of packing units or
individual items;
b) the amount of the Letter of Credit is not exceeded; and
c) the Letter of Credit does not stipulate that the quantity of goods
specified must not be exceeded or reduced.
 Variance is not restricted to 5%; you may specify another variance,
e.g.+/- 15%.
 Note: When you allow a variance, remember to clearly advise whether that
variance applies to both the Value ($) and the Quantity or to the Value
($) only.

 N  Trade Terms.  These are commonly referred to as INCO terms.  They
determine the obligations of the Exporter and Importer with respect to
freight costs, insurance, taxes, duties, etc.  These terms are issued by the
International Chamber of Commerce.  A list of the more commonly used
INCO terms can be found on the reverse of the application form
illustrated on page 15.  You may wish to refer to the International
Chamber of Commerce’s publication “Guide to INCO terms” for more
information.
 Example:  If the trade term is F.O.B.  (Free on Board) Kaoshiung, Taiwan,
it will be marked “Freight Collect” on the transport document,
since the Importer (Applicant) is responsible for paying all
freight charges and insurance from Kaoshiung, Taiwan to 
the point of destination.
 O  Documents Required.  The following is a list of documents commonly
requested in a Letter of Credit.  The documents you choose will be
determined in the contract between you and the Exporter.
 Commercial Invoice.  The commercial invoice is normally required.
 Indicate whether you require original signed copies of the invoice or
simply copies of the original.  You must also stipulate the number of
copies that are required.
 Transport Documents.  The following are simple guidelines to assist you
in making your selection.  It is advisable that you refer to the UCP 500,
Articles 23-33 for more detailed information.
 In general, a transport document provides evidence the carrier has
received the goods it is responsible to ship. 
Some transport documents,
such as a Marine/Ocean Bill of Lading, also carry title to the goods.  A
transport document is negotiable if it transfers title to the goods.
 16
A Guide to Letters of Credit
17
Full Set Of: A full set refers to the number of original documents being 
issued.  Generally Bills of Lading are issued in three originals.  If the 
method of transportation includes an ocean vessel, indicate which of the 
following two documents are required:
1.  Multimodal Transport Document.  For shipments using more than
one mode of transportation, e.g. 
ocean vessel and truck.

2. 
On Board Marine/Ocean Bill of Lading. 
Used for ocean shipments
from one ocean port to another.  For a city to be considered a port,
it must be accessible by ocean vessel year round.
 Issued by: You may specify who is to issue the transport documents.
 Marked Freight Prepaid or Collect.  Check the appropriate box as to
whether the freight charges will be prepaid by the Exporter or if they are
the responsibility of the Importer and are therefore collect.  This should be
consistent with the trade term used in Section N.
Notify: Name the party to be notified once the goods arrive at the 
destination point.
 Air Transport Document.  Transport document used when the shipment
is by air.  This is a non-negotiable document; therefore, it does not carry
title to the goods.  You must indicate to whom the goods are being
consigned, e.g. 
yourself (Applicant) or TD.

Trucking/Rail Bill of Lading. 
Transport document for shipment by truck
or rail. 
These bills of lading are not negotiable and are usually consigned
to you, the Applicant, but may be consigned to another named party.
 A Guide to Letters of Credit
18
Insurance Documents
Policy/Certificate.  This document must be requested if the Exporter is
responsible for arranging insurance on the shipment.  It is recommended
that the minimum amount of insurance be 110% of the invoice value.
 You must also state what risks the insurance policy is covering.  A
standard insurance policy will cover all risks.  The term “all risks”,
however, does not mean that all risks are covered.  Certain risks such as
war, strikes and riots are not included and must be specifically requested.
 It is important to understand that there is a difference between an
insurance policy and a certificate of issuance.  Refer to the UCP 500,
Articles 34-36 for detailed information regarding insurance.  It is also
recommended that you seek professional advice from your insurance
broker or agent.
 Other Documents
You may request documents other than those listed above.  For all
documents in this category, you must stipulate which party will issue the
document as well as the wording of the document, otherwise it will be
accepted as presented.  The following is a list of commonly used
documents that fall into this category.

Generalized System of Preference Certificate of Origin Form “A”. 
This
document certifies the country of origin of the goods being shipped and
may provide the Importer with a preferential duty rate.  Indicate how
many copies are required.  You should contact Canada Customs or 
your customs broker for information regarding whether this document 
is required.
 Packing List.  A list of the packing of goods being sent, which can assist
you in the inventory and distribution of the merchandise.
 Canada Customs Invoice.  Imports into Canada require that a Canada
Customs invoice be presented.  This invoice can be prepared by you;
however, it may be called for in the Letter of Credit.  If this document is
being requested, you must indicate how many copies you require.
 Inspection Certificate.  An Inspection Certificate may be requested from a
third party or an agent of the Importer located in the country of dispatch,
to ensure a certain quality of goods.  In this case, you must stipulate the
A Guide to Letters of Credit
19
issuer of such a Certificate and, if necessary, the content or wording of the
Certificate, otherwise banks will accept such a document as presented.  It
is recommended that an Inspection Certificate be requested wherever
possible.

Weight List.  A document stating the weight of the goods.
 P
Special Conditions
Transport Documents issued by Freight Forwarders Acceptable.
 Exporters often use the services of a freight forwarder to transport goods
and prepare documents relating to the shipment.  Indicate here whether
documents prepared by a freight forwarder are acceptable to you.
 Please Advice Beneficiary by Phone or Fax.  If it is urgent that the
Beneficiary be notified immediately of the Letter of Credit, please include
instructions as to who the Advising Bank must call or fax upon its
receipt.
 Q  Documents to be Presented Within.  Refers to the number of days after
shipment in which the Exporter is allowed to present documents to the
“available with” Bank.  The shortest possible presentation time is
recommended to ensure that the importer receives documents prior to
the arrival of goods at destination.
 R   Banking Charges.  Indicate who will pay the Exporter’s banking charges
along with the charges of any other bank outside of Canada that is
involved in the transaction, such as the Reimbursing Bank.  It is not
uncommon for all banking charges outside Canada to be for the
Beneficiary’s account.  Note that the Issuing Bank charges are always the
responsibility of you, the Applicant.

S   Date. 
Your branch must insert the date that you signed the Continuing
Documentary Credit Agreement.  Two authorized bank officers must sign
and indicate their signature numbers.
 A Guide to Letters of Credit
20
T  Your company name must be typed/printed in full and the appropriate
company-signing officers must sign the form.
 Once the branch has received the application form and upon approval, it
will be forwarded to TD’s nearest Global Trade Finance office.  Please note
that Letter of Credit applications can also be handled electronically
through the Internet using tdfacilitrade.  You can feel secure knowing that
the submitted application form will be closely reviewed and any
clarifications will be discussed with you. 
 Amendments to a Letter of Credit
After issuance of a Letter of Credit, changes can be done through
amendments subject to acceptance by the Exporter.  Amendments to the
Letter of Credit will be required when either the Importer or the Exporter
is unable to comply with the terms of the sale agreement or the
agreement has been changed. 
For example, an Exporter will ask for an
amendment to extend the expiry date and the latest shipping date if they
are unable to manufacture the merchandise according to the agreed upon
time.  An Importer may request an amendment to increase the value of
the Letter of Credit if they subsequently decide to purchase a higher
quantity of merchandise.
 The Importer must complete an amendment application listing all
required changes and forward the request to the respective Global Trade
Finance office via the same route the original application was sent.  TD
clients with access to tdfacilitrade can forward amendments via the
Internet.  Amendment requests will be processed subject to credit approval
by the Issuing Bank where necessary. 
 Any amendments to the Letter of Credit must be accepted by the Exporter
and where more than one change is included in an amendment, they
must be accepted as a whole as opposed to accepting or rejecting
individual items within the amendment.
 A Guide to Letters of Credit
21
Q When the Letter of Credit expiry date is set, should enough time be
allowed for the goods to reach me or for payment to be made when
extended payment terms have been negotiated (e.g. 
60 days after
sight)?

A No. 
The expiry date should simply allow the Exporter sufficient time,
after the latest shipping date, to present documents to the “available with”
Bank.  In a Letter of Credit, the Importer is not allowed the opportunity to
inspect the goods prior to paying for them.  Keep in mind that banks deal
only in documents and not in goods.
 Q Is there any way that I can protect myself by using a Letter of Credit to
ensure I do not get inferior quality goods?
 A Yes.  This can be done by requesting appropriate third party documents to
be submitted under the Letter of Credit that would evidence shipment of
the proper goods, e.g.  Inspection Certificate, Health Certificate, Agent’s
Certificate, etc.
 Q How quickly will the Exporter receive my Letter of Credit?
 A Once the Letter of Credit application form is received by TD’s Global
Trade Finance office, the Letter of Credit will be issued within 24 hours.  If
it is sent by teletransmission/SWIFT, the Advising Bank will receive the
advice the same business day or the next business day the latest.  You may
include instructions in the application form for the Advising Bank to
notify the Beneficiary by phone or fax and that you also include the
relevant numbers to be used, enabling the Exporter to receive a copy of
the Letter of Credit without delay.

Q What is the cost to issue a Letter of Credit?
 A The fees vary based on the dollar amount of your Letter of Credit 
and the length of time it is outstanding.  You should contact your TD
branch for a Fee Schedule.
 Questions Commonly Asked 
by Importers
22
Q Under a Letter of Credit, what recourse is available to me if the
quantity or quality of goods is different from what was agreed upon?
 A Since banks deal only in documents and not in goods, all disputes 
of whatever nature may either be referred to International Chamber of
Commerce Arbitration or handled through courts of law.
 Q What happens if my ocean shipment arrives before my transport
documents?
 A You have two options.  One is to wait for the shipping documents to arrive
which may result in payment of demurrage charges.  The other option
often used by importers is to obtain a shipping guarantee.  A shipping
guarantee is a bond of indemnity your bank will issue to the shipping line
allowing you to obtain the imported goods without producing the original
transport documents.  Obviously the bank will note the liability of the
shipping guarantee against your line of credit.
 When original transport documents do arrive you must hand them over to
the shipping company who will return the bond of indemnity to you
which you must deliver back to the bank to free your line of credit.

23
Step-by-Step Process for the Exporter
The following is a detailed explanation of the process you, as an Exporter
follow when named as a Beneficiary under a Letter of Credit.  In this
explanation, TD is acting as the Advising Bank and Confirming Bank.

1. 
There are several different ways to notify you that a Letter of Credit has
been issued in your favour.  TD’s Export Letter of Credit Department will
call you directly and obtain instructions as to how you would like to
receive the Letter of Credit.  The choices include:
•  Faxing a copy of the Letter of Credit.
 •  Sending the original Letter of Credit by courier or mail.
 •  Electronically downloading the content of the Letter of Credit via
tdfacilitrade, allowing you to print your own copy of the Letter of Credit.
 tdfacilitrade even allows you to electronically forward the contents of
the Letter of Credit to your Freight Forwarder.  For more information,
please contact the Global Trade Finance office nearest you.
 Please note that an Exporter does not have to be a TD customer to be
advised of a Letter of Credit through TD.
 2.  Upon receipt of the Letter of Credit, you should read it carefully paying
close attention to all terms and conditions to ensure they can be met.
 Accompanying the Letter of Credit is a covering letter which includes the
address of TD’s Global Trade Finance office and the appropriate phone
numbers to call with any questions regarding the Letter of Credit. 
See
page 26 for an illustration of a Letter of Credit in SWIFT format.
 3.  If any of the terms and conditions in the Letter of Credit differ from the
sales contract between you and the Importer, you should request an
amendment to the Letter of Credit.  It is recommended that shipments not
be made against the Letter of Credit until all amendments have been
received.  Please refer to page 20 for further information regarding
amendments.
 4.  Once you are satisfied with the terms and conditions of the Letter of
Credit and the shipment is made, all documents requested in the Letter of
Credit must be prepared or obtained.  You would then forward these
documents, along with the draft (if required) and a copy of the original
Letter of Credit, to TD’s Global Trade Finance office listed in the covering
letter.
 Letters of Credit – 
Exporter’s Perspective
24
5.  TD checks these documents to ensure compliance with the terms and
conditions outlined in the Letter of Credit.  If the documents contain
discrepancies, TD will discuss how they may be corrected as well as what
other options are available. 
Discrepancies are discussed on page 34.

6. 
When the documents are in order, payment under the Letter of Credit 
is made to the Exporter or, in the case of a term Letter of Credit, payment
will be made on the maturity date of the accepted draft.
 Unconfirmed vs.  Confirmed Letter of Credit
For the Exporter, the issue of whether or not a Letter of Credit is
confirmed is an extremely important one.
 When a Letter of Credit is issued, the risk of payment rests with the bank
that has issued the Letter of Credit.  This is an Unconfirmed Letter of Credit.
 However, it may be that the Issuing Bank is not considered an acceptable
risk and/or the country where it is located has high political or economic
uncertainty.  In this situation, the Exporter should consider requesting a
Confirmed Letter of Credit.  With a Confirmed Letter of Credit, another
bank, the “Confirming Bank”, usually located in the same country that the
Exporter is located, will add its “confirmation” to the Letter of Credit.  By
adding its confirmation, the Confirming Bank undertakes to honour the
Exporter’s claim under the Letter of Credit, provided all terms and
conditions of the Letter of Credit are met.  The risk of payment is now
assumed by the Confirming Bank, as well as the Issuing Bank, thereby
providing more protection for the Exporter.
 25
How to Confirm a Letter of Credit
An Exporter who decides to have a Letter of Credit confirmed should
inform the Importer to instruct the Issuing Bank to issue a “Confirmed
Irrevocable Letter of Credit”.  The Issuing Bank must request a third bank,
generally the Advising Bank, to advise the Letter of Credit to the Exporter
adding their confirmation.  The Confirming Bank will charge a fee for
undertaking such risk.  The question of which party bears the cost of the
confirmation is subject to negotiation between the Exporter and Importer.

Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Credit it is recommended that the
Exporter check with its own bank as to whether the bank is prepared to
add its confirmation, should it be requested to do so.  To make this
decision, the bank will need preliminary information about the Letter of
Credit such as the name of the Issuing Bank, country of issuance, expiry
date and amount.
 If the Advising Bank has agreed to confirm a Letter of Credit, it also
becomes the Confirming Bank.  In the case of a Confirmed Letter of
Credit, the covering letter attached to the Letter of Credit will include a
clause similar to the following:
“This Credit carries our confirmation and we hereby engage, with the
drawers, endorses and holders in due course of drafts drawn under this
Credit, that such drafts will be duly honoured on presentation at our counter,
provided that all terms and conditions of the Credit have been complied
with.”

What an Exporter Should Look for When Reviewing a Letter of Credit 
(Refer to the sample of an Export Letter of Credit on opposite page)
1.

Which bank issued the Letter of Credit (L/C)? 
(L/C header under
“Received From:”) Is this bank a reputable one that can be relied on for
payment? 
(Contact TD’s local Global Trade Finance office if unsure.)  If
not, does the Letter of Credit allow for confirmation by another bank?
 (field 49)
2.
 Is the Letter of Credit irrevocable?  (Field 40A) If it is not stated, the L/C is
irrevocable.

3.
 Are the Importer’s (Applicant’s) name and address spelled correctly?
 (Field 50)
4.

Are your name and address spelled correctly? 
(Field 59)
5.
 Are the dollar amount and currency of the Letter of Credit correct? 
 (Field 32B)
6.
 Does the payment term agree with the sales contract?  (Field 42C)
7.
 If necessary, are partial shipments allowed?  (Field 43P)
8.
 Are the points of shipment (Field 44 A) and destination (Field 44B) 
as agreed?
 9.
 Is it possible for you to meet the latest shipping date?  (Field 44C) Are
enough days allowed to present documents?  (Field 48) You may need to
check with the freight forwarder handling the shipment and preparing
documents for you.
 A Guide to Letters of Credit
28
10.  Is the merchandise description correct and, if needed, does it include unit
price, weight and quantities?  (Field 45A ) If necessary, does the Letter of
Credit allow for any variance on the quantity and/or dollar amount?
 11.  Are the terms of the sale regarding insurance and freight charges as
agreed?  (Field 45A)
12.  Can all documents listed in the Letter of Credit be obtained? 
(Field 46 A)
13.  Which party is responsible for banking charges?  (Field 71b)
14. 
Where is the Letter of Credit payable?  (Field 41D) Note: this will affect the
length of time required to receive your funds.
 After reviewing the Letter of Credit, if you find any terms and
conditions unsatisfactory, you must ask the Importer (Applicant) to
instruct the Issuing Bank to make the necessary amendments to the
Letter of Credit.  It is recommended that you not proceed with 
shipment until such amendments are received.

How to Convey Letter of Credit Requirements to the Importer
As an Exporter, you can be proactive and tell your customer (the Importer)
exactly what terms and conditions you are agreeable to in a Letter of Credit.
 While this will not guarantee the Letter of Credit will arrive exactly as you
specified, it can help avoid misunderstandings between you and the
Importer.  A sample of a Letter of Credit requisition form is illustrated on
page 29.  To obtain a copy, please contact the local Global Trade Finance
office.

You may also request that the Letter of Credit be advised through the TD
Bank regardless of whether or not TD is your banker.  Simply provide the
Importer with the address and SWIFT code of TD’s nearest Global Trade
Finance office.  Please see back cover of this guide for a listing of these
offices.
 Document Preparation Checklist
The following checklist is intended to provide the Exporter with simple
guidelines for document preparation.  Note that in addition to checking the
documents for inconsistencies with the Letter of Credit, the “available with”
Bank checks for inconsistencies among documents.
 It is recommended that Exporters unfamiliar with Letters of Credit use or
consult with a reputable freight forwarder.  Since payment to the Exporter
depends on the documents being in full compliance with the Letter of
Credit, the preparation of these documents is an extremely important part
of the Letter of Credit process.
 Draft
A Draft, also known as a Bill of Exchange, is a legally enforceable
instrument, which is regarded as formal evidence of debt under a Letter of
Credit.  It is defined as an unconditional order in writing addressed by one
person to another, signed by the person giving it, and requiring the
addressee to pay at a fixed or determinable time a certain sum of money
to or to the order of a specified party. 
A draft must be presented with all
other documents requested in the Letter of Credit, unless stipulated
otherwise.  Drafts may be obtained from any of TD’s Global Trade Finance
offices.

A Guide to Letters of Credit
Dealing with Discrepancies
Any inconsistency found in documents presented or failure to comply
with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit is deemed a
“discrepancy.”
Certain discrepancies may be corrected by the Exporter either by
amending the original documents or by replacing them with new ones. 
 If discrepancies are noted in the Bill of Lading, insurance document or
consularized invoice, the document(s) must be returned to the issuing
party for correction, if desired by the Exporter.
 Options Available to the Exporter When Documents are Discrepant
If certain non-correctable discrepancies are noted, such as late shipment 
or presentation of documents past the expiry date, TD will contact the
Exporter to request handling instructions. 
The Exporter has three options, as
follows:
1. 
Forward Document on Approval.  TD sends the documents at the
Exporter’s risk to the Issuing Bank, noting the relevant discrepancies.  In
this scenario, the Exporter believes that the Importer will approve the
discrepancies.  It also may be that the shipment has already arrived or is
about to arrive and the Exporter does not want the shipment to incur a
demurrage charge.
 When the documents are received by the Issuing Bank, they will be
checked and the discrepancies referred to the Importer for acceptance.
 Meanwhile, the documents will not be released to the Importer until the
Issuing Bank receives the Importer’s approval of the discrepancies.  Upon
receipt of the Importer’s approval, payment will be made under the Letter
of Credit.
 Note:
It is advantageous for the Exporter to advise the Importer
directly of the discrepancies to ensure a quick response when 
the Importer is contacted by the Issuing Bank.
 34
A Guide to Letters of Credit
2.  Cable for Approval.  At the request of the Exporter, TD sends a SWIFT
message to the Issuing Bank requesting authority to negotiate the
documents and noting the discrepancies found.  The Issuing Bank, in turn,
will notify the Importer of these discrepancies.  The Importer will then
indicate to the Issuing Bank whether the documents are acceptable with
the discrepancies noted.  If authorization to waive the discrepancies is
received (by TD from the Issuing Bank), TD will send the documents to
the Issuing Bank and payment will be made according to the Letter of
Credit terms.

3. 
Indemnity.  The Exporter may provide TD with an acceptable Indemnity
Agreement for the discrepancies.  Such indemnity enables TD to effect
payment immediately, even though there are discrepancies in the
documents.  If documents are not accepted by the Importer, TD has the
right to claim the funds back from the Exporter under the Indemnity
Agreement.
 Acceptances
A Letter of Credit is said to be a “Term Letter of Credit” or “ Usance Letter
of Credit” when extended payment terms are agreed to, such as 60 days
after sight or 60 days after Bill of Lading date.  Once documents and a
usance draft are presented under a “Term Letter of Credit” and are found
to be in good order, instead of paying the Exporter right away, the Drawee
Bank “accepts” the draft, which is essentially a promise to pay the Exporter
on the maturity date stated in the draft.  The Accepting Bank holds the
accepted draft until maturity or the draft can be returned to the
Beneficiary, depending on the Beneficiary’s preference.
 Once a draft has been accepted, it becomes a negotiable instrument called
a Banker’s Acceptance or simply referred to as an Acceptance.

Acceptances may be discounted as discussed on the next page.
 35
A Guide to Letters of Credit
Discounting Acceptances
Instead of holding an Acceptance until the maturity date, the Exporter
may have the accepted draft “discounted” at prevailing discount rates.  This
allows the Exporter to receive payment, net of discount charges, as soon as
the draft has been accepted, instead of waiting until the maturity date.  In
addition to the Exporter receiving funds prior to the maturity date,
another advantage to discounting is that the discount rate is based on the
risk of the Accepting Bank and therefore is usually lower than the
Exporter’s borrowing rate.  Contact one of TD’s Global Trade Finance
offices for further information.
 Assignment of Proceeds
The Beneficiary may assign part or all of the proceeds of the Letter of
Credit to a third party (assignee) such as a supplier.  A key point for the
assignee to keep in mind is that payment is forthcoming only if the
Exporter receives payment under the Letter of Credit, over which the
assignee has no control. 
An assignment of proceeds is irrevocable and
therefore all parties must consent to any changes.
 Assigning proceeds may be an acceptable alternative to a supplier who
otherwise might request a Letter of Credit or demand funds in advance of
shipment.
 36
A Guide to Letters of Credit
Procedure to Assign Proceeds
1.  An Assignment of Proceeds form must be completed by the Exporter once
the Letter of Credit is received.  This form can be obtained directly from
one of TD’s Global Trade Finance offices.
 2.  Once the form has been completed, it is sent back to the Global Trade
Finance office for acknowledgment.
 3.  An advice of the assignment is sent to the designated assignee.

Questions Commonly Asked by Exporters
Q I have received a Letter of Credit, but it does not meet the sale terms
agreed upon.  What should I do?
 A If the Letter of Credit is not acceptable to you, you should request an
amendment to the Letter of Credit from the Importer.  Refer to page 20
for details on amendments.  If the Importer does not agree to the request
for amendment, you may refuse to ship against the Letter of Credit and
simply let it expire unused.

Q What is the fee for having a Letter of Credit confirmed?
 A The confirmation fee is calculated as a percentage of the face value of the
Letter of Credit and is based on both the risks of the Issuing Bank and
the country in which it is domiciled. 
The fee is usually quoted on a per-
90-day period and currently ranges upwards from approximately 0.10%.
 The rate is subject to change at anytime based on prevailing market
conditions.

Q I just received a payment advice under a Letter of Credit detailing a list
of charges.  What are “Reimbursing Bank” charges?
 A A Reimbursing Bank is one authorized by the Issuing Bank to facilitate
the transfer of funds between TD and the Issuing Bank.  It may be
necessary to have a Reimbursing Bank involved because reimbursement
is in a foreign currency or because the Issuing Bank and TD do not share
settlement accounts.  The Reimbursing Bank will charge a fee to facilitate
the payment.  This fee is the responsibility of the Exporter if the Letter of
Credit states that all charges outside of the Importer’s country will be
paid by the Exporter.
 Q I received a Letter of Credit advised by a Canadian bank other than TD.
 Can I still negotiate my documents with TD?
 A If the Letter of Credit states that it is “negotiable with any bank”, then you
may negotiate your documents with TD.  This information is found in the
Letter of Credit SWIFT format in field 41D “Available with . 
.  . 
“.

Q How do I get a copy of the Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits (UCP) 500, (1993 revision)?
 A You can obtain a copy from your local TD branch or from one of 
TD’s Global Trade Finance offices listed on the back cover 
of this guide.

A Guide to Letters of Credit
The basis of a Standby Letter of Credit is that it may be drawn on by the
Beneficiary when the Applicant (Buyer) has failed to perform in
accordance with the underlying contract between the Applicant and
Beneficiary.
 In simple terms, a Standby Letter of Credit is “standing by” to protect the
Beneficiary in case the Applicant defaults on an agreed-upon contract.
 Standby Letters of Credit are either governed by the Uniforms Customs
and Practice for Documentary Credit (UCP) or the International Standby
Practice (ISP) rules.
 Unlike a Documentary Letter of Credit, the usual documents called for
under a Standby Letter of Credit are no more than a written demand (or
sight draft) from the Beneficiary, accompanied by its statement that the
Applicant has defaulted in performance of the agreed-upon contract.

Because the documents are much less stringent, the risk of a Standby
Letter of Credit rests more heavily on the Applicant than the Beneficiary.
 A Standby Letter of Credit, therefore, should be issued only when the
Applicant has no doubt as to the trustworthiness and integrity of the
Beneficiary.
 Standby Letters of Credits are used in a variety of forms.  Most commonly
they are used for Bid Bonds, Performance Bonds, Advance Payment
Guarantees, Warranty Bonds, and to secure financial obligations of
obligors.  Often suppliers ask their buyers to provide Standby Letters of
Credits as security for goods sold on open account.  A Lessor may request a
Standby Letter of Credit from a Lessee to cover lease obligations.  These
are some of examples of Standby Letter of Credits and, in the event of a
default, the beneficiary could demand payment from the issuing bank of
the Standby Letter of Credit.
 It is also important to recognize the distinction between Guarantees and
Standby Letters of Credits. 
Both Standby Letter of Credits and Guarantees
obligate the Issuing Bank to make payment to a beneficiary in the event of
a default.  However, the distinction is attributable to the rules and laws
under which each instrument is issued.  Typically Guarantees are issued
subject to local laws while Standby Letters of Credits are issued subject to
Uniform Customs and Practice Rules or International Standby Practice
Rules.
 39
Standby Letters of Credit
The following example illustrates the use of a Standby Letter of Credit.
 Example
A Canadian shoe importer, Best Shoes Importer Inc., has signed a one-year
contract with a supplier in Brazil, Brazilian Shoes Supplier Inc., agreeing
to purchase on open account leather shoes valued at CAD $30,000/month.
 Under the open account arrangement, payment must be made 30 days
after the invoice date.  To guarantee payment by Best Shoes Importer Inc.,
Brazilian Shoes Supplier Inc.  requires that an Irrevocable Standby Letter
of Credit with an expiry date of one year from the date of issue be issued
in its favour for CAD $30,000.

 Back-to-Back Letter of Credit
When one Letter of Credit is used to secure the issuance of another Letter
of Credit, the parties are said to be dealing with a “Back-to-Back” Letter of
Credit transaction.  Such a transaction is often requested by an
intermediary party, such as a broker, to provide settlement to a supplier
from which the goods are purchased.
 In a Back-to-Back Letter of Credit scenario, the intermediary party would
receive and be the Beneficiary of a Letter of Credit from its customer that
has agreed to purchase goods.  This Letter of Credit is referred to as the
Primary Credit.  Subsequently, the intermediary party must issue a Letter
of Credit, referred to as the Secondary Credit, to its supplier, for a lesser
amount than the one received.  At this point, the intermediary party would
approach a bank, offering the Primary Credit as collateral for issuance of
the Secondary Credit.

The acceptance of the Primary Credit as security for the Secondary Credit
is extremely risky to the intermediary party’s bank.  Circumstances may
arise that prevent the intermediary party from meeting the terms and
conditions in the Primary Credit e.g.  insolvency.  Therefore, the
intermediary party’s bank would be unable to draw under the Primary
Credit it has taken as collateral.  The supplier that received the Secondary
Credit, however, would not be precluded from drawing under its Letter of
Credit and, the intermediary party’s bank is obligated to honour the
drawing even though it could not collect funds under the Primary Credit.
 Due to the inherent riskiness of a Back-to-Back Letter of Credit transaction,
banks will likely not participate in such a transaction.  As an alternative,
the intermediary party’s bank may recommend using a Transferable
Letter of Credit (described on next page).
 42
Other Types of Letters of Credit
Transferable Letter of Credit
A Transferable Letter of Credit is used in cases where there are three
parties to a transaction as described in the Back-to-Back Letter of Credit
transaction; an Importer (Buyer), Exporter (Seller), and an intermediary
party, such as a broker, who is responsible for arranging the sale.
 In such a transaction, the intermediary party requests a Letter of Credit
from the Importer as protection against non-payment. 
The Exporter, in
turn, wants assurance from the intermediary party that payment will be
made, and will also request a Letter of Credit.  It may be the case, however,
that the intermediary party has little working capital or does not have
access to a line of credit with its bank to issue a separate Letter of Credit
to the Exporter.  As an alternative, the intermediary party may provide
such assurance to the Exporter by transferring over a portion of the Letter
of Credit it received from the Importer.  This is termed a Transferable
Letter of Credit.
 To transfer a Letter of Credit, the intermediary party must request a
Transferable Letter of Credit from the Importer.
 If the Letter of Credit is not designated to be transferable, it cannot be
transferred.  The Letter of Credit can, however, be amended to allow it to
be transferable.  In addition the Letter of Credit must nominate a bank,
generally the Advising Bank, who is authorized to effect a transfer.
 The intermediary party would be the Beneficiary of the Letter of Credit
and, in a Transferable Letter of Credit transaction, is referred to as the
First Beneficiary. 
The First Beneficiary would then ask the Transferring
Bank to transfer, in part or in full, its rights under the Letter of Credit to
the manufacturer of the goods, which is referred to as the Second
Beneficiary.
 A Transferable Letter of Credit may be transferred only once; therefore, a
Second Beneficiary is unable to transfer a portion of a Transferable Letter
of Credit to a third beneficiary.  It may, however, be transferred to more
than one Second Beneficiary.
 43
A Guide to Letters of Credit
Example
The following is a simplified example of a Transferable Letter of
Credit transaction:
Importer:
ABC Buyer
Intermediary Party:
Canadian Maple Trading Company
Manufacturer:
XYZ Supplier Canada
Issuing Bank:
WorldWide Bank
Transferring Bank:
TD Bank
As per ABC Buyer’s instructions, WorldWide Bank issued a
Transferable Letter of Credit in favour of Canadian Maple Trading
Company, which is acting as the intermediary party in the trade
transaction.  This Transferable Letter of Credit is in the amount of
USD $100,000 and TD Bank is authorized and willing to do the
transfer. 
The description of goods is 5,000 pairs of moccasins at USD
$20 per pair.  Once Canadian Maple Trading Company as the First
Beneficiary receives the Letter of Credit, it requests TD Bank to
transfer USD $75,000 to XYZ Supplier Canada, stating the same
quantity of goods, 5,000 pairs of moccasins, but at USD $15 per pair.
 TD Bank advises the transfer has been made to XYZ Supplier
Canada, which now becomes the Secondary Beneficiary of the Letter
of Credit.
 Once XYZ Supplier Canada has shipped the goods, it presents
documents in accordance with the Transferable Letter of Credit,
along with its draft for USD $75,000, to TD Bank.  TD Bank then
notifies Canadian Maple Trading Company of the presentation.
 Canadian Maple will present its own invoice and draft showing a
value of USD $100,000.  TD Bank then substitutes these documents
with the draft and invoice presented by XYZ Supplier Canada and
forwards the documents to WorldWide Bank.  TD Bank receives USD
$100,000 and pays USD $75,000 to XYZ Supplier Canada and USD
$25,000 to Canadian Maple Trading Company.

A Guide to Documentary Letters of Credit


LETTERS OF CREDIT, THE UCP600 AND 
DOCUMENTARY REQUIREMENTS
Letters of credit (LCs) are one of the 
most common methods of payment for 
goods in international trade.
 An LC is a contract by which a bank agrees to pay the 
beneficiary upon the happening of a specific event or, in 
connection with the export of specific goods, against the 
presentation of specified documents.  The use of LCs to 
effect payment is widespread in international trade.  This 
is because they offer security of payment for and receipt 
of goods to contractual counterparties who may be in 
different jurisdictions to each other – and who may be 
contracting to buy and sell goods which are located in a 
third jurisdiction, or which are in transit.

LCs are standalone contracts, separate from the sale 
contract, and banks are concerned only with the LC 
contract, not the sale contract. 
(Article 4 UCP 600).  A 
feature common to all types of LCs is that money is raised 
on the documents, not on delivery of the goods (Article 5 
UCP 600). 
 UCP 600 – What are they and why do they matter?
 The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary 
Credits (“UCP”) 600 are international rules published 
by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) with 
the aim of standardising international banking practice 
in relation to LCs.  The UCP 600 are only applicable if 
they are expressly incorporated (and there is provision 
for including them at field 40E in the SWIFT MT700). 
 However, although a voluntary code, the majority of LCs 
are governed by the UCP 600.  They are trans-national 
in application and comprise of 39 articles setting out 
detailed requirements which govern the scope of a 
bank’s obligations and which reflect universal custom 
and practice.  It is possible to amend their application to 
an LC by modification or exclusion.  The UCP 600 replaced 
the UCP 500 in July 2007, with the aim of reducing 
ambiguity and the possibility of rejecting documents.
 Other rules
● 
ISBP (International Standard Banking Practice) 745: 
to be read in conjunction with UCP 600 but not 
incorporated into the LC. 
This defines terms not 
defined in UCP 600, such as “shipping documents” 
and “shipping marks”.

● 
URDG (Uniform Rules on Demand Guarantees) 758: 
covers demand guarantees and counter guarantees.
 ● 
ISP (International Standby Practices) 98: intended to 
be the standard reference for Standby LCs and more 
specialised than UCP 600. 
 CLIENT GUIDE
KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT
Different Types of LC
● 
Documentary – an obligation by the issuing bank to 
pay the agreed amount to the beneficiary (usually the 
seller) on behalf of the applicant (buyer) upon receipt 
of the specified documents.
 ● 
Standby – this operates more like a demand 
guarantee.  It is a secondary rather than a primary 
obligation to pay, usually triggered by non-
performance.  It does not have to be issued by a bank. 
 The issuer undertakes to pay in the event of default 
by the applicant and presentation of conforming 
documents by the beneficiary.
 ● 
Irrevocable/revocable – A revocable LC can be 
changed or cancelled by the issuing bank at any time 
and for any reason.  An irrevocable LC offers more 
security as it cannot be changed or cancelled unless 
all parties agree. 
 ● 
Transferable – this is an LC with an added provision 
permitting the bank to transfer the sum specified by 
the LC to another party at the request of the original 
beneficiary.

● 
Back-to-back – two LCs, one issued by the buyer’s 
bank to an intermediary and the next issued by the 
intermediary’s bank to the seller, usually to conceal the 
ultimate seller’s identity from the ultimate buyer.
 ● 
Revolving – a single LC which can cover multiple 
shipments, so the credit can be renewed either as to 
the amount or as to the time it is available.  These are 
often used where regular shipments are made from 
the same seller over a period of time.
 ● 
Sight Credit or Usance Credit – generally LCs are paid 
“at sight” of the compliant documents by the bank.  A 
usance credit is not paid at sight but at a future date,
1.  Seller and Buyer agree sales contract – with payment 
to be made by LC.
 2.  Buyer requests Issuing Bank to issue the LC – this is 
the Bank’s own irrevocable undertaking to pay the 
Beneficiary on compliance with conditions.  Buyer 
agrees to indemnify Bank and gives pledge over 
documents.
 3.  LC issued and sent to Seller’s local bank (known as 
Advising Bank).

4.  Advising Bank examines LC and informs Seller (and 
adds own undertaking if it is also Confirming Bank).
 5. 
Seller ships goods to Buyer.

6.  Seller presents documents under LC to Advising Bank 
(also called Nominated Bank if nominated as paying 
bank).
 7.  (a&b) Documents are checked.  If they are in order, 
payment is made and documents are forwarded to 
Issuing Bank.
 8.  Documents are checked and reimbursement is made 
to Confirming Bank.
 9.  Documents are released against payment from Buyer 
(or other arrangements).
 10.  Buyer uses documents to obtain possession of goods.

Structure of a Typical Documentary LC Transaction
● 
Confirmed L/C and Silent Confirmed L/C – 
Confirmation is usually requested if the seller is 
concerned about the creditworthiness of the issuing 
bank and/or the buyer’s country risk.  The advising 
bank adds its confirmation to the LC at the issuing 
bank’s request The advising bank then becomes 
the confirming bank and undertakes to pay the 
beneficiary if the LC is complied with (this is a separate 
undertaking from the one given by the issuing 
bank and so offers extra security to the seller).  Silent 
confirmation happens when the seller, not the issuing 
bank, requests confirmation, which is not disclosed to 
the other parties in the transaction.
 Requirements for documents presented under an LC:
All documents required under the LC must be 
submitted.
 Description: the description of the goods in the 
commercial invoice must correspond with that appearing 
in the LC (Article 18 UCP 600) but other documents may 
contain a description in general terms provided that it 
does not conflict with the LC.

Date: transport documents and insurance documents 
must be dated.
 Originality: original documents are required (Article 17 
UCP 600).
 Strict Compliance: documents must conform strictly to 
the terms of the LC unless the misdescription or typing 
error is regarded as trivial. 
 Timing of presentation: documents must be presented to 
the confirming or issuing bank (as the case may be) within 
the time limits stated in the LC and within 21 calendar days 
after the shipment date.  (UCP 600 Article 14(c))
Consistency: “Data in a document, when read in context 
with the credit, the document itself and international 
standard banking practice, need not be identical to, but 
must not conflict with, data in that document, any other 
stipulated document or the credit”.  (UCP 600 Article 
14(d))
Some documents carry specific requirements:
● 
Commercial invoice:
 -
The description of the goods must be full and 
accurate.
  -
The amount must not exceed the amount of the 
credit – but the bank may pay the maximum 
amount of the credit (UCP 600 Article 18(b)).
 
-
The name of both beneficiary and applicant must 
appear.
  -
The currency must match the credit.
 
-
It need not be signed.

● 
Transport documents (e.g. 
bill of lading):
 -
These must be “clean”.
 
-
They must indicate the name of the carrier 
 -
They must be signed.
  -
There must be full coverage from the place of 
loading to place of discharge.
  -
There must be a full set of originals.
  -
A charterparty B/L cannot be used.
 Specific requirements also apply to other documents 
such as insurance documents and certificates.
 Bank’s obligations: standard of examination:
The Bank must decide, on the basis of the documents 
alone, whether the documents appear on their face 
to be compliant (UCP 600 Article 14(a)).  A complying 
presentation is one that meets the requirements of the 
credit and the applicable provisions of the UCP 600 and 
international standard banking practice (UCP 600 Article 
2).  The Bank has a maximum of 5 banking days following 
the day of presentation to determine if a presentation is 
complying. 
(UCP 600 Article 14(b)). 
The UCP600 imposes 
a doctrine of strict compliance – the documents must 
comply - there is no “de minimis” rule.

Discrepancies
Documents which comply in all respects will trigger 
payment under the LC.  Where documentary 
presentations do not comply strictly with the 
requirements, they are known as discrepant.  If the 
advising bank accepts non-conforming documents it 
may not be reimbursed by the issuing bank.
 Ten common examples of discrepancies include:
1.  Invoice value exceeds the amount available under 
the LC. 
 2.  Bills of lading are not clean - meaning they bear 
notations that call into question the condition of 
the goods.
 3.  Bills of lading are not endorsed. 

4.  Bills of lading are made out “to order” (shipper’s 
order, blank endorsed) but the LC stipulates 
“straight” (direct to consignee) bills of lading, or vice 
versa.
 5. 
Not all documents required by the LC are 
presented. 

6.  Documents are “stale dated” that is, not presented 
within a reasonable time after issuance.
 7. 
The invoice does not specify the shipment terms 
(CIF, FOB, etc.) 
as stated in the LC.

8.  The invoice is not signed as the LC requires.
 9.  Late shipment.
 10. 
Shipment to/from incorrect ports.
 Treatment of discrepancies
UCP 600 Article 16 deals with discrepant documents, 
waiver and notice.  Where documents do not comply, the 
bank may:
● 
Refuse to honour the credit.
 ● 
In its sole discretion, approach the applicant for a 
waiver of the discrepancies.
 ● 
If the bank refuses to honour the credit, it must give 
a notice stating this and listing each discrepancy.  It 
must state:
 -
that the bank is holding the documents pending 
further instructions from the presenter; or
 -
that the bank is holding the documents pending a 
waiver from the applicant; or
 -
that the bank is returning the documents; or
 -
that the bank is acting in accordance with 
instructions previously received from the presenter.
 If an Issuing or Confirming bank fails to follow this 
procedure, it will be prevented from claiming that the 
documents presented are not compliant.
 Notwithstanding the doctrine of strict compliance, courts 
will ignore trivial defects. 
These have been held to include 
listing a buyer’s telex number with one digit incorrect. 
 Trivial defects were found not to include: 
● 
Referring to goods as “Any Western Brand-Indonesia 
(Inalum Brand) instead of “Any Western Brand”.
 ● 
Certifying courier charges at issuing bank’s cost rather 
than at beneficiary’s cost.

● 
Specifying minimum protein content as 67% rather 
than 70% required.

● 
Omission of an ampersand (“&”) or the word “and” 
from the name of a company.

INTRODUCTION      
 
 
Since the approval of International Standard Banking Practice (ISBP) by the ICC Banking 
Commission in 2002, ICC Publication 645 has become an invaluable aid to banks, corporates, 
logistics specialists and insurance companies alike, on a global basis. 
Participants in ICC 
seminars and workshops have indicated that rejection rates have dropped due to the application 
of the 200 practices that are detailed in ISBP. 
 
 However, there have also been comments that although the ISBP Publication 645 was approved 
by the Banking Commission its application had no relationship with UCP 500.  With the 
approval of UCP 600 in October 2006, it has become necessary to provide an updated version 
of the ISBP.  It is emphasized that this is an updated version as opposed to a revision of ICC 
Publication 645.  Where it was felt appropriate, paragraphs that appeared in Publication 645 and 
that have now been covered in effectively the same text in UCP 600 have been removed from 
this updated version of ISBP. 
 
 As a means of creating a relationship between the UCP and ISBP, the introduction to UCP 600, 
states: “During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been 
completed in creating the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of 
Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP), ICC Publication 645. 
This publication has 
evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for determining compliance of documents with 
the terms of letters of credit.  It is the expectation of the Drafting Group and the Banking 
Commission that the application of the principles contained in the ISBP, including subsequent 
revisions thereof, will continue during the time UCP 600 is in force.  At the time UCP 600 is 
implemented, there will be an updated version of the ISBP to bring its contents in line with the 
substance and style of the new rules.” 
 
The international standard banking practices documented in this publication are consistent with 
UCP 600 and the Opinions and Decisions of the ICC Banking Commission.  This document 
does not amend UCP 600.  It explains how the practices articulated in UCP 600 are applied by 
documentary practitioners.  This publication and the UCP should be read in their entirety and 
not in isolation.  It is, of course, recognized that the law in some countries may compel a 
different practice than those stated here. 
 
 No single publication can anticipate all the terms or the documents that may be used in 
connection with documentary credits or their interpretation under UCP 600 and the standard 
practice it reflects.  However, the Task Force that prepared Publication 645 endeavoured to 
cover terms commonly seen on a day-to-day basis and the documents most often presented 
under documentary credits.  The Drafting Group have reviewed and updated this publication to 
conform with UCP 600. 
 
 It should be noted that any term in a documentary credit which modifies or excludes the 
applicability of a provision of UCP 600 may also have an impact on international standard 
banking practice. 
Therefore, in considering the practices described in this publication, parties 
must take into account any term in a documentary credit that expressly modifies or excludes a 
rule contained in UCP 600.  This principle is implicit throughout this publication.  Where 
examples are given, these are solely for the purpose of illustration and are not exhaustive. 
 6 
 
This publication reflects international standard banking practice for all parties to a documentary 
credit.  Since applicants’ obligations, rights and remedies depend upon their undertaking with 
the issuing bank, the performance of the underlying transaction and the timeliness of any 
objection under applicable law and practice, applicants should not assume that they may rely on 
these provisions in order to excuse their obligations to reimburse the issuing bank.  The 
incorporation of this publication into the terms of a documentary credit should be discouraged, 
as the requirement to follow agreed practices is implicit in UCP 600. 
 
 

7 
 
PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS 
 
The application and issuance of the credit 
1) 
The terms of a credit are independent of the underlying transaction even if a credit 
expressly refers to that transaction.  To avoid unnecessary costs, delays, and disputes in 
the examination of documents, however, the applicant and beneficiary should 
carefully consider which documents should be required, by whom they should be 
produced and the time frame for presentation. 
 2) 
The applicant bears the risk of any ambiguity in its instructions to issue or amend a 
credit.  Unless expressly stated otherwise, a request to issue or amend a credit 
authorizes an issuing bank to supplement or develop the terms in a manner necessary 
or desirable to permit the use of the credit.   
 3) 
The applicant should be aware that UCP 600 contains articles such as  3, 14, 19, 20, 21, 
23, 24, 28(i), 30 and 31 that define terms in a manner that may produce unexpected 
results unless the applicant fully acquaints itself with these provisions.  For example, a 
credit requiring presentation of a bill of lading and containing a prohibition against 
transhipment will, in most cases, have to exclude UCP 600 sub-article 20(c) to make 
the prohibition against transhipment effective. 
 4) 
A credit should not require presentation of documents that are to be issued or 
countersigned by the applicant.  If a credit is issued including such terms, the 
beneficiary must either seek amendment or comply with them and bear the risk of 
failure to do so. 
 5) 
Many of the problems that arise at the examination stage could be avoided or resolved 
by careful attention to detail in the underlying transaction, the credit application, and 
issuance of the credit as discussed. 

8 
 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES 
Abbreviations 
6) 
The use of generally accepted abbreviations, for example “Ltd.” instead of “Limited”, 
“Int’l” instead of “International”, “Co.” instead of “Company”, “kgs” or “kos.” instead 
of “kilos”, “Ind” instead of “Industry”, “mfr” instead of  “manufacturer” or “mt” 
instead of “metric tons” – or vice versa – does not make a document discrepant.    
 7) 
Virgules (slash marks “/”) may have different meanings, and unless apparent in the 
context used, should not be used as a substitute for a word.  

Certifications and declarations  
8) 
A certification, declaration or the like may either be a separate document or contained 
within another document as required by the credit.  If the certification or declaration 
appears in another document which is signed and dated, any certification or 
declaration appearing on that document does not require a separate signature or date if 
the certification or declaration appears to have been given by the same entity that 
issued and signed the document. 
 Corrections and alterations   
9) 
Corrections and alterations of information or data in documents, other than documents 
created by the beneficiary, must appear to be authenticated by the party who issued the 
document or by a party authorized by the issuer to do so.  Corrections and alterations in 
documents which have been legalized, visaed, certified or similar, must appear to be 
authenticated by the party who legalized, visaed, certified etc., the document.  The 
authentication must show by whom the authentication has been made and include the 
signature or initials of that party. 
If the authentication appears to have been made by a 
party other than the issuer of the document, the authentication must clearly show in 
which capacity that party has authenticated the correction or alteration. 
 10) 
Corrections and alterations in documents issued by the beneficiary itself, except drafts, 
which have not been legalized, visaed, certified or similar, need not be authenticated. 
 See also “Drafts and calculation of maturity date”.    
 11) 
The use of multiple type styles or font sizes or handwriting in the same document does 
not, by itself, signify a correction or alteration. 
 12) 
Where a document contains more than one correction or alteration, either each 
correction must be authenticated separately or one authentication must be linked to all 
corrections in an appropriate way.  For example, if the document shows three 
corrections numbered 1, 2 and 3, one statement such as “Correction numbers 1, 2 and 3 
above authorized by XXX” or similar, will satisfy the requirement for authentication. 
 Dates 
13) 
Drafts, transport documents and insurance documents must be dated even if a credit 
does not expressly so require.  A requirement that a document, other than those 
mentioned above, be dated, may be satisfied by reference in the document to the date 
of another document forming part of the same presentation (e.g., where a shipping 
9 
certificate is issued which states “date as per bill of lading number xxx” or similar 
terms).  Although it is expected that a required certificate or declaration in a separate 
document be dated, its compliance will depend on the type of certification or 
declaration that has been requested, its required wording and the wording that appears 
within it.  Whether other documents require dating will depend on the nature and 
content of the document in question.  
 14) 
Any document, including a certificate of analysis, inspection certificate and 
pre-shipment inspection certificate, may be dated after the date of shipment.  However, 
if a credit requires a document evidencing a pre-shipment event (e.g., pre-shipment 
inspection certificate), the document must, either by its title or content, indicate that 
the event (e.g., inspection) took place prior to or on the date of shipment. 
A 
requirement for an “inspection certificate” does not constitute a requirement to 
evidence a pre-shipment event.  Documents must not indicate that they were issued 
after the date they are presented. 
 15) 
A document indicating a date of preparation and a later date of signing is deemed to be 
issued on the date of signing.  
 16) 
Phrases often used to signify time on either side of a date or event:  
a) “within 2 days after” indicates a period from the date of the event until 2 days 
after the event.  
 b) “not later than 2 days after” does not indicate a period, only a latest date.  If an 
advice must not be dated prior to a specific date, the credit must so state.  
 c) “at least 2 days before” indicates that something must take place not later than 
2 days before an event.  There is no limit as to how early it may take place. 
 d) “within 2 days of” indicates a period 2 days prior to the event until 2 days after 
the event. 
 
 17) 
The term “within” when used in connection with a date excludes that date in the 
calculation of the period. 

18) 
Dates may be expressed in different formats, e.g., the 12th of November 2007 could be 
expressed as 12 Nov 07, 12Nov07, 12.11.2007, 12.11.07, 2007.11.12, 11.12.07, 
121107, etc. 
Provided that the date intended can be determined from the document or 
from other documents included in the presentation, any of these formats are acceptable. 
 To avoid confusion it is recommended that the name of the month should be used 
instead of the number.   
 
 Documents for which the UCP 600 transport articles do not apply 
19) 
Some documents commonly used in relation to the transportation of goods, e.g., 
Delivery Order, Forwarder’s Certificate of Receipt, Forwarder’s Certificate of 
Shipment, Forwarder’s Certificate of Transport, Forwarder’s Cargo Receipt and 
Mate’s Receipt do not reflect a contract of carriage and are not transport documents as 
defined in UCP 600 articles 19 - 25.  As such, UCP 600 sub-article 14(c) would not 
apply to these documents.  Therefore, these documents will be examined in the same 
manner as other documents for which there are no specific provisions in UCP 600, i.e., 
under sub-article 14(f).  In any event, documents must be presented not later than the 
expiry date for presentation as stated in the credit.     

10 
20) 
Copies of transport documents are not transport documents for the purpose of UCP 
600 articles 19-25 and sub-article 14(c).  The UCP 600 transport articles apply where 
there are original transport documents presented. 
Where a credit allows for the 
presentation of a copy transport document rather than an original, the credit must 
explicitly state the details to be shown.  Where copies (non-negotiable) are presented, 
they need not evidence signature, dates, etc. 
 Expressions not defined in UCP 600 
21) 
Expressions such as “shipping documents”, “stale documents acceptable”, “third party 
documents acceptable”, and “exporting country” should not be used as they are not 
defined in UCP 600.  If used in a credit, their meaning should be made apparent.  If not, 
they have the following meaning under international standard banking practice: 
a) 
“shipping documents” – all documents (not only transport documents), except 
drafts, required by the credit. 
 b) 
“stale documents acceptable” – documents presented later than 21 calendar 
days after the date of shipment are acceptable as long as they are presented no 
later than the expiry date for presentation as stated in the credit. 
 c) 
“third party documents acceptable” – all documents, excluding drafts but 
including invoices, may be issued by a party other than the beneficiary.  If it is 
the intention of the issuing bank that the transport or other documents may 
show a shipper other than the beneficiary, the clause is not necessary because 
it is already permitted by sub-article 14(k).    
 d) 
“exporting country” – the country where the beneficiary is domiciled, or the 
country of origin of the goods, or the country of receipt by the carrier or the 
country from which shipment or dispatch is made.   

Issuer of documents 
22) 
If a credit indicates that a document is to be issued by a named person or entity, this 
condition is satisfied if the document appears to be issued by the named person or 
entity.  It may appear to be issued by a named person or entity by use of its letterhead, 
or, if there is no letterhead, the document appears to have been completed or signed by, 
or on behalf of, the named person or entity.  
 Language 
23) 
Under international standard banking practice, it is expected that documents issued by 
the beneficiary will be in the language of the credit.  When a credit states that 
documents in two or more languages are acceptable, a nominated bank may, in its 
advice of the credit, limit the number of acceptable languages as a condition of its 
engagement in the credit. 
 Mathematical calculations 
24) 
Detailed mathematical calculations in documents will not be checked by banks.  Banks 
are only obliged to check total values against the credit and other required documents. 
 

11 
Misspellings or typing errors  
25) 
A misspelling or typing error that does not affect the meaning of a word or the sentence 
in which it occurs, does not make a document discrepant.  For example, a description of 
the merchandise as “mashine” instead of “machine”, “fountan pen” instead of 
“fountain pen” or “modle” instead of “model” would not make the document 
discrepant.  However, a description as “model 123” instead of “model 321” would not 
be regarded as a typing error and would constitute a discrepancy.   
 Multiple pages and attachments or riders 
26) 
Unless the credit or a document provides otherwise, pages which are physically bound 
together, sequentially numbered or contain internal cross references, however named 
or entitled, are to be examined as one document, even if some of the pages are regarded 
as an attachment.  Where a document consists of more than one page, it must be 
possible to determine that the pages are part of the same document. 
 27) 
If a signature or endorsement is required to be on a document consisting of more than 
one page, the signature is normally placed on the first or last page of the document, but 
unless the credit or the document itself indicates where a signature or endorsement is 
to appear, the signature or endorsement may appear anywhere on the document. 

Originals and copies  
28) 
Documents issued in more than one original may be marked “Original”, “Duplicate”, 
“Triplicate”, “First Original”, “Second Original”, etc.  None of these markings will 
disqualify a document as an original. 
 29) 
 The number of originals to be presented must be at least the number required by the 
credit, the UCP 600, or, where the document itself states how many originals have 
been issued, the number stated on the document. 
 30) 
It can sometimes be difficult to determine from the wording of a credit whether it 
requires an original or a copy, and to determine whether that requirement is satisfied 
by an original or a copy. 
 For example, where the credit requires: 
a) 
“Invoice”, “One Invoice” or “Invoice in 1 copy”, it will be understood to be a 
 
requirement for an original invoice. 
 b) “Invoice in 4 copies”, it will be satisfied by the presentation of at least one 
 
original and the remaining number as copies of an invoice. 
 c) 
“One copy of Invoice”, it will be satisfied by presentation of either a copy or an 
 
original of an invoice.  
 
 31) 
Where an original would not be accepted in lieu of a copy, the credit must prohibit an 
original, e.g., “photocopy of invoice – original document not acceptable in lieu of 
photocopy”, or the like.  Where a credit calls for a copy of a transport document and 
indicates the disposal instructions for the original of that transport document, an 
original transport document will not be acceptable. 

32) 
Copies of documents need not be signed. 
 

12 
33) 
In addition to UCP 600 article 17, the ICC Banking Commission Policy Statement, 
document 470/871(Rev), titled “The determination of an “Original” document in the 
context of UCP 500 sub-Article 20(b)” is recommended for further guidance on 
originals and copies and remains valid under UCP 600.   The content of the Policy 
Statement appears in the Appendix of this publication, for reference purposes. 
 Shipping marks  
34) 
The purpose of a shipping mark is to enable identification of a box, bag or package.  If 
a credit specifies the details of a shipping mark, the documents mentioning the marks 
must show these details, but additional information is acceptable provided it is not in 
conflict with the credit terms. 
 35) 
Shipping marks contained in some documents often include information in excess of 
what would normally be considered “shipping marks”, and could include information 
such as the type of goods, warnings as to the handling of fragile goods, net and/or gross 
weight of the goods, etc.  The fact that some documents show such additional 
information, while others do not, is not a discrepancy. 
 36) 
Transport documents covering containerized goods will sometimes only show a 
container number under the heading “Shipping marks”.  Other documents that show a 
detailed marking will not be considered to be in conflict for that reason. 
  
 Signatures 
37) 
Even if not stated in the credit, drafts, certificates and declarations by their nature 
require a signature. 
Transport documents and insurance documents must be signed in 
accordance with the provisions of UCP 600. 
 38) 
The fact that a document has a box or space for a signature does not necessarily mean 
that such box or space must be completed with a signature.  For example, banks do not 
require a signature in the area titled “Signature of shipper or their agent” or similar 
phrases, commonly found on transport documents such as air waybills or road 
transport documents.  If the content of a document indicates that it requires a signature 
to establish its validity (e.g., “This document is not valid unless signed” or similar 
terms), it must be signed.  
 39) 
A signature need not be handwritten.  Facsimile signatures, perforated signatures, 
stamps, symbols (such as chops) or any electronic or mechanical means of 
authentication are sufficient.  However, a photocopy of a signed document does not 
qualify as a signed original document, nor does a signed document transmitted through 
a fax machine, absent an original signature.  A requirement for a document to be 
“signed and stamped”, or a similar requirement, is also fulfilled by a signature and the 
name of the party typed, or stamped, or handwritten, etc. 
 40) 
A signature on a company letterhead paper will be taken to be the signature of that 
company, unless otherwise stated.  The company name need not be repeated next to the 
signature. 
 
 Title of documents and combined documents 
41) 
Documents may be titled as called for in the credit, bear a similar title, or be untitled. 

For example, a credit requirement for a “Packing List” may also be satisfied by a 
document containing packing details whether titled “Packing Note”, “Packing and 
13 
Weight List”, etc., or an untitled document.  The content of a document must appear to 
fulfil the function of the required document.  
 42) 
Documents listed in a credit should be presented as separate documents.  If a credit 
requires a packing list and a weight list, such requirement will be satisfied by 
presentation of two separate documents, or by presentation of two original copies of a 
combined packing and weight list, provided such document states both packing and 
weight details.

DRAFTS AND CALCULATION OF MATURITY DATE 
 
Tenor 
43) 
The tenor must be in accordance with the terms of the credit. 
 a) 
If a draft is drawn at a tenor other than sight, or other than a certain period after 
sight, it must be possible to establish the maturity date from the data in the 
draft itself. 
 b) 
As an example of where it is possible to establish a maturity date from the data 
in the draft, if a credit calls for drafts at a tenor 60 days after the bill of lading 
date, where the date of the bill of lading is 12 July 2007, the tenor could be 
indicated on the draft in one of the following ways: 
i. 

“60 days after bill of lading date 12 July 2007”, or 
ii. 
 “60 days after 12 July 2007”, or 
iii. 
 “60 days after bill of lading date” and elsewhere on the face of the draft 
state “bill of lading date 12 July 2007”, or 
iv. 
 “60 days date” on a draft dated the same day as the date of the bill of 
lading, or 
v. 
 “10 September 2007”, i.e.  60 days after the bill of lading date. 
 c) 
If the tenor refers to xxx days after the bill of lading date, the on board date is 
deemed to be the bill of lading date even if the on board date is prior to or later 
than the date of issuance of the bill of lading. 
 d) 
UCP 600 article 3 provides guidance that where the words “from” and “after” 
are used to determine maturity dates of drafts,  the calculation of the maturity 
commences the day following the date of the document, shipment, or other 
event, i.e., 10 days after or from March 1 is March 11. 
e) 
If a bill of lading showing more than one on board notation is presented under 
a credit which requires drafts to be drawn, for example, at 60 days after or 
from bill of lading date, and the goods according to both or all on board 
notations were shipped from ports within a permitted geographical area or 
region, the earliest of these on board dates will be used for calculation of the 
maturity date.  Example: the credit requires shipment from European port, and 
the bill of lading evidences on board vessel “A” from Dublin August 16 and 
on board vessel “B” from Rotterdam August 18. 
The draft should reflect 60 
days from the earliest on board date in a European port, i.e., August 16.   
f) 
If a credit requires drafts to be drawn, for example, at 60 days after or from bill 
of lading date, and more than one set of bills of lading is presented under one 
draft, the date of the last bill of lading will be used for the calculation of the 
maturity date. 
 
 44) 
While the examples refer to bill of lading dates, the same principles apply to all 
transport documents. 
 Maturity date 
45) 
If a draft states a maturity date by using an actual date, the date must have been 
calculated in accordance with the requirements of the credit. 
 15 
46) 
For drafts drawn “at XXX days sight”, the maturity date is established as follows: 
a) 
in the case of complying documents, or in the case of non-complying 
documents where the drawee bank has not provided a notice of refusal, the 
maturity date will be XXX days after the date of receipt of documents by the 
drawee bank. 
 b) 
in the case of non-complying documents where the drawee bank has provided 
a notice of refusal and subsequent approval, at the latest XXX days after the 
date of acceptance of the draft by the drawee bank. 
The date of acceptance of 
the draft must be no later than the date the issuing bank accepts the waiver of 
the applicant.  
 47) 
In all cases the drawee bank must advise the maturity date to the presenter.  The 
calculation of tenor and maturity dates, as shown above, would also apply to credits 
designated as being available by deferred payment, i.e., where there is no requirement 
for a draft to be presented by the beneficiary. 
 
 Banking days, grace days, delays in remittance 
48) 
Payment must be available in immediately available funds on the due date at the place 
where the draft or documents are payable, provided such due date is a banking day in 
that place.  If the due date is a non-banking day, payment will be due on the first 
banking day following the due date.  Delays in the remittance of funds, such as grace 
days, the time it takes to remit funds, etc., must not be in addition to the stated or 
agreed due date as defined by the draft or documents. 
 
 Endorsement 
49) 
The draft must be endorsed, if necessary. 
 
 Amounts 
50) 
The amount in words must accurately reflect the amount in figures if both are shown, 
and indicate the currency, as stated in the credit. 
 51) 
The amount must agree with that of the invoice, unless as a result of UCP 600 
sub-article 18(b). 
 
 How the draft is drawn 
52) 
The draft must be drawn on the party stated in the credit. 
 53) 
The draft must be drawn by the beneficiary. 
 
 Drafts on the applicant 
54) 
A credit may be issued requiring a draft drawn on the applicant as one of the required 
documents, but must not be issued available by drafts drawn on the applicant.  
 Corrections and alterations 
55) 
Corrections and alterations on a draft, if any, must appear to have been authenticated 
by the drawer. 
 56) 
In some countries a draft showing corrections or alterations will not be acceptable even 
with the drawer’s authentication.  Issuing banks in such countries should make a 
16 
statement in the credit to the effect that no correction or alteration must appear in the 
draft.   

17 
 
INVOICES 
Definition of invoice 
57) 
A credit requiring an “invoice” without further definition will be satisfied by any type of 
invoice presented (commercial invoice, customs invoice, tax invoice, final invoice, 
consular invoice, etc.).  However, invoices identified as “provisional”, “pro-forma” or 
the like are not acceptable.  When a credit requires presentation of a commercial invoice, 
a document titled “invoice” will be acceptable. 
 Description of the goods, services or performance and other general issues related 
to invoices 
58)  
The description of the goods, services or performance in the invoice must correspond 
with the description in the credit.  There is no requirement for a mirror image.  For 
example, details of the goods may be stated in a number of areas within the invoice 
which, when collated together, represents a description of the goods corresponding to 
that in the credit.  
 59)  
The description of goods, services or performance in an invoice must reflect what has 
actually been shipped or provided.  For example, where there are two types of goods 
shown in the credit, such as 10 trucks and 5 tractors, an invoice that reflects only 
shipment of 4 trucks would be acceptable provided the credit does not prohibit partial 
shipment.  An invoice showing the entire goods description as stated in the credit, then 
stating what has actually been shipped is also acceptable.  
 60)  
An invoice must evidence the value of the goods shipped or services or performance 
provided. 
Unit price(s), if any, and currency shown in the invoice must agree with that 
shown in the credit.  The invoice must show any discounts or deductions required in the 
credit.  The invoice may also show a deduction covering advance payment, discount, etc., 
not stated in the credit.  
 61)  
If a trade term is part of the goods description in the credit, or stated in connection with 
the amount, the invoice must state the trade term specified, and if the description 
provides the source of the trade term, the same source must be identified (e.g., a credit 
term “CIF Singapore Incoterms 2000” would not be satisfied by “CIF Singapore 
Incoterms”).  Charges and costs must be included within the value shown against the 
stated trade term in the credit and invoice.  Any charges and costs shown beyond this 
value are not allowed. 
 62)  
Unless required by the credit, an invoice need not be signed or dated.   
 63)  
The quantity of merchandise, weights and measurements shown on the invoice must not 
conflict with the same quantities appearing on other documents. 

64)  
An invoice must not show: 
a) 
over-shipment (except as provided in UCP 600 sub-article 30(b)), or  
b) 
merchandise not called for in the credit (including samples, advertising 
materials, etc.)  even if stated to be free of charge.  
 
 65)  
The quantity of the goods required in the credit may vary within a tolerance of +/- 5%. 
 This does not apply if a credit states that the quantity must not be exceeded or reduced, 
18 
or if a credit states the quantity in terms of a stipulated number of packing units or 
individual items.  A variance of up to +5% in the goods quantity does not allow the 
amount of the drawing to exceed the amount of the credit. 
 66)  
Even when partial shipments are prohibited, a tolerance of 5% less in the credit amount 
is acceptable, provided that the quantity is shipped in full and that any unit price, if 
stated in the credit, has not been reduced.  If no quantity is stated in the credit, the 
invoice will be considered to cover the full quantity.    

67) 
If a credit calls for instalment shipments, each shipment must be in accordance with the 
instalment schedule.  
 19 
 
 TRANSPORT DOCUMENT COVERING AT LEAST TWO DIFFERENT 
MODES OF TRANSPORT 
 
Application of UCP 600 article 19 
68)  
If a credit requires presentation of a transport document covering transportation 
utilizing at least two modes of transport (multimodal or combined transport document), 
and if the transport document clearly shows that it covers a shipment from the place of 
taking in charge or port, airport or place of loading to the place of final destination 
mentioned in the credit, UCP 600 article 19 is applicable.  In such circumstances, the 
transport document must not indicate that shipment or dispatch has been effected by 
only one mode of transport, but it may be silent regarding the modes of transport 
utilized.  
 69) 
In all places where the term “multimodal transport document” is used within this 
document, it also includes the term combined transport document. 
A document need not 
be titled “Multimodal transport document” or “Combined transport document” to be 
acceptable under UCP 600 article 19, even if such expressions are used in the credit. 
 
 Full set of originals 
70)  
A UCP 600 article 19 transport document must indicate the number of originals that 
have been issued.  Transport documents marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, 
“Third Original”, “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate”, etc., or similar expressions are 
all originals.  Multimodal transport documents need not be marked “original” to be 
acceptable under a credit.  In addition to UCP 600 article 17, the ICC Banking 
Commission Policy Statement, document 470/871(Rev), titled “The determination of an 
‘Original’ document in the context of UCP 500 sub-Article 20(b)” is recommended for 
further guidance on originals and copies and remains valid under UCP 600.  The content 
of the Policy Statement appears in the Appendix of this publication, for reference 
purposes. 
 
 Signing of multimodal transport documents 
71)  
Original multimodal transport documents must be signed in the form described in UCP 
600 sub-article 19(a)(i) and indicate the name of the carrier, identified as the carrier. 
 a. 
If an agent signs a multimodal transport document on behalf of the carrier, the 
agent must be identified as agent, and must identify on whose behalf it is signing, 
unless the carrier has been identified elsewhere on the multimodal transport 
document.  

b. 
If the master (captain) signs the multimodal transport document, the signature of 
the master (captain) must be identified as “master” (“captain”).  In this event, the 
name of the master (captain) need not be stated. 
 c. 
If an agent signs the multimodal transport document on behalf of the master 
(captain), the agent must be identified as agent.  In this event, the name of the 
master (captain) need not be stated. 
 
 72) 
 If a credit states “Freight Forwarder’s Multimodal transport document is acceptable” or 
uses a similar phrase, then the multimodal transport document may be signed by a 
20 
freight forwarder in the capacity of a freight forwarder, without the need to identify 
itself as carrier or agent for the named carrier.  In this event, it is not necessary to show 
the name of the carrier.  
 
 On board notations 
73)  
The issuance date of a multimodal transport document will be deemed to be the date of 
dispatch, taking in charge or shipped on board unless it bears a separate dated notation 
evidencing dispatch, taking in charge or shipped on board from the location required by 
the credit, in which event the date of the notation will be deemed to be the date of 
shipment whether or not the date is before or after the issuance date of the document. 
 74)  
“Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “clean on board” or other phrases 
incorporating words such as “shipped” or “on board” have the same effect as “Shipped 
on board”.  
 

Place of taking in charge, dispatch, loading on board and destination 
75) 
 If a credit gives a geographical range for the place of taking in charge, dispatch, loading 
on board and destination (e.g., “Any European Port”), the multimodal transport 
document must indicate the actual place of taking in charge, dispatch, shipped on board 
and destination, which must be within the geographical area or range stated in the credit. 
 
 Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement, notify party 
76) 
If a credit requires a multimodal transport document to show that the goods are 
consigned to a named party, e.g., “consigned to Bank X” (a “straight” consignment), 
rather than “to order” or “to order of Bank X”, the multimodal transport document must 
not contain words such as “to order” or “to order of” that precede the name of that 
named party, whether typed or pre-printed.  Likewise, if a credit requires the goods to be 
consigned “to order” or “to order of” a named party, the multimodal transport document 
must not show that the goods are consigned straight to the named party. 

77)  
If a multimodal transport document is issued to order or to order of the shipper, it must 
be endorsed by the shipper.  An endorsement indicating that it is made for or on behalf of 
the shipper is acceptable. 
 78)  
If a credit does not stipulate a notify party, the respective field on the multimodal 
transport document may be left blank or completed in any manner. 
 
 Transhipment and partial shipment 
79)  
In a multimodal transport, transhipment will occur, i.e., unloading from one means of 
conveyance and reloading to another means of conveyance (whether or not in different 
modes of transport) during the carriage from the place of dispatch, taking in charge or 
shipment to the place of final destination stated in the credit.  
 80) 
 If a credit prohibits partial shipments and more than one set of original multimodal 
transport documents are presented covering shipment, dispatch or taking in charge from 
one or more points of origin (as specifically allowed, or within the geographical area or 
range stated in the credit), such documents are acceptable, provided that they cover the 
movement of goods on the same means of conveyance and same journey and are 
destined for the same destination. 
In the event that more than one set of multimodal 
transport documents are presented and if they incorporate different dates of shipment, 
dispatch or taking in charge, the latest of these dates will be taken for the calculation of 
21 
any presentation period and such date must fall on or before any latest date of shipment, 
dispatch or taking in charge specified in the credit. 
 81)  
Shipment on more than one means of conveyance (more than one truck (lorry), vessel, 
aircraft, etc.)  is a partial shipment, even if such means of conveyance leave on the same 
day for the same destination. 
 
 Clean multimodal transport documents 
82)  
Clauses or notations on multimodal transport documents that expressly declare a 
defective condition of the goods or packaging are not acceptable.  Clauses or notations 
that do not expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or packaging (e.g., 
“packaging may not be sufficient for the journey”) do not constitute a discrepancy.  A 
statement that the packaging “is not sufficient for the journey” would not be acceptable.  
 

83)  
If the word “clean” appears on a multimodal transport document and has been deleted, 
the multimodal transport document will not be deemed to be claused or unclean unless it 
specifically bears a clause or notation declaring that the goods or packaging are 
defective. 
 
 Goods description 
84)  
A goods description in the multimodal transport document may be shown in general 
terms not in conflict with that stated in the credit. 
 
 Corrections and alterations 
85)  
Corrections and alterations on a multimodal transport document must be authenticated. 
 Such authentication must appear to have been made by the carrier or master (captain) or 
any one of their agents who may be different from the agent that may have issued or 
signed it, provided they are identified as an agent of the carrier or master (captain).   
 86)  
Non-negotiable copies of multimodal transport documents do not need to include any 
signature on, or authentication of, any alterations or corrections that may have been 
made on the original.  
 

Freight and additional costs 
87)  
If a credit requires that a multimodal transport document show that freight has been paid 
or is payable at destination, the multimodal transport document must be marked 
accordingly.   
 88)  
Applicants and issuing banks should be specific in stating the requirements of 
documents to show whether freight is to be prepaid or collected. 
 89)  
If a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a multimodal 
transport document must not indicate that costs additional to the freight have been or 
will be incurred.  Such indication may be by express reference to additional costs or by 
the use of shipment terms which refer to costs associated with the loading or unloading 
of goods, such as Free In (FI), Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out 
Stowed (FIOS).  A reference in the transport document to costs which may be levied as a 
result of a delay in unloading the goods or after the goods have been unloaded e.g., costs 
covering the late return of containers, is not considered to be an indication of additional 
costs in this context. 

22 
Goods covered by more than one multimodal transport document 
90) 
If a multimodal transport document states that the goods in a container are covered by 
that multimodal transport document plus one or more other multimodal transport 
documents, and the document states that all multimodal transport documents must be 
surrendered or words of similar effect, this means that all multimodal transport 
documents related to that container must be presented in order for the container to be 
released.  Such a multimodal transport document is not acceptable unless all the 
multimodal transport documents form part of the same presentation under the same 
credit. 
 
 BILL OF LADING 
 
Application of UCP 600 Article 20 
91) 
 If a credit requires presentation of a bill of lading (“marine”, “ocean” or “port-to-port” 
or similar) covering sea shipment only, UCP 600 article 20 is applicable. 
 92)  
To comply with UCP 600 article 20, a bill of lading must appear to cover a port-to-port 
shipment but need not be titled “marine bill of lading”, “ocean bill of lading”, 
“port-to-port bill of lading” or similar.  
 
 Full set of originals 
93)  
A UCP 600 article 20 transport document must indicate the number of originals that 
have been issued. 
Transport documents marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, 
“Third Original”, “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate”, etc., or similar expressions are 
all originals.  Bills of lading need not be marked “original” to be acceptable as an 
original bill of lading.  In addition to UCP 600 article 17, the ICC Banking Commission 
Policy Statement, document 470/871(Rev), titled “The determination of an ‘Original’ 
document in the context of UCP 500 sub-Article 20(b)” is recommended for further 
guidance on originals and copies and remains valid under UCP 600.  The content of the 
Policy Statement appears in the Appendix of this publication, for reference purposes. 
 
 Signing of bills of lading 
94)  
Original bills of lading must be signed in the form described in UCP 600 sub-article 
20(a)(i) and indicate the name of the carrier, identified as the carrier.  
 d. 
If an agent signs a bill of lading on behalf of the carrier, the agent must be 
identified as agent and must identify on whose behalf it is signing, unless the 
carrier has been identified elsewhere on the bill of lading.  

e. 
If the master (captain) signs the bill of lading, the signature of the master 
(captain) must be identified as “master” (“captain”).  In this event, the name of 
the master (captain) need not be stated.  
 f. 
If an agent signs the bill of lading on behalf of the master (captain), the agent 
must be identified as agent.  In this event, the name of the master (captain) need 
not be stated.  
 
 95)  
If a credit states “Freight Forwarder’s Bill of Lading is acceptable” or uses a similar 
phrase, then the bill of lading may be signed by a freight forwarder in the capacity of a 
23 
freight forwarder, without the need to identify itself as carrier or agent for the named 
carrier.  In this event, it is not necessary to show the name of the carrier.  
 
 On board notations 
96)  
If a pre-printed “Shipped on board” bill of lading is presented, its issuance date will be 
deemed to be the date of shipment unless it bears a separate dated on board notation, in 
which event the date of the on board notation will be deemed to be the date of shipment 
whether or not the on board date is before or after the issuance date of the bill of lading.  
 97) 
“Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “clean on board” or other phrases 
incorporating words such as “shipped” or “on board” have the same effect as “Shipped 
on board”.  
 

Ports of loading and ports of discharge 
98)  
While the named port of loading, as required by the credit, should appear in the port of 
loading field within the bill of lading, it may instead be stated in the field headed “Place 
of receipt” or the like, if it is clear that the goods were transported from that place of 
receipt by vessel, and provided there is an on board notation evidencing that the goods 
were loaded on that vessel at the port stated under “Place of receipt” or like term.  
 99)  
While the named port of discharge, as required by the credit, should appear in the port of 
discharge field within the bill of lading, it may be stated in the field headed “Place of 
final destination” or the like if it is clear that the goods were to be transported to that 
place of final destination by vessel, and provided there is a notation evidencing that the 
port of discharge is that stated under “Place of final destination” or like term.  
 100)  If a credit gives a geographical area or range of ports of loading or discharge (e.g., “Any 
European Port”), the bill of lading must indicate the actual port of loading or discharge, 
which must be within the geographical area or range stated in the credit.  
 

Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement, notify party 
101) 
If a credit requires a bill of lading to show that the goods are consigned to a named party, 
e.g., “consigned to Bank X” (a “straight” bill of lading), rather than “to order” or “to 
order of Bank X“, the bill of lading must not contain words such as “to order” or “to 
order of” that precede the name of that named party, whether typed or pre-printed. 
 Likewise, if a credit requires the goods to be consigned “to order” or “to order of” a 
named party, the bill of lading must not show that the goods are consigned straight to the 
named party. 
 102)  If a bill of lading is issued to order or to order of the shipper, it must be endorsed by the 
shipper.  An endorsement indicating that it is made for or on behalf of the shipper is 
acceptable. 
 103)  If a credit does not state a notify party, the respective field on the bill of lading may be 
left blank or completed in any manner.  
 
 Transhipment and partial shipment 
104)  Transhipment is the unloading from one vessel and reloading to another vessel during 
the carriage from the port of loading to the port of discharge stated in the credit.  If it 
does not occur between these two ports, unloading and reloading is not considered to be 
transhipment. 
 24 
105)  If a credit prohibits partial shipments and more than one set of original bills of lading are 
presented covering shipment from one or more ports of loading (as specifically allowed, 
or within the geographical area or range stated in the credit), such documents are 
acceptable provided that they cover the shipment of goods on the same vessel and same 
journey and are destined for the same port of discharge.  In the event that more than one 
set of bills of lading are presented and incorporate different dates of shipment, the latest 
of these dates of shipment will be taken for the calculation of any presentation period 
and must fall on or before the latest shipment date specified in the credit.  Shipment on 
more than one vessel is a partial shipment, even if the vessels leave on the same day for 
the same destination. 
 
 Clean bills of lading  
106)  Clauses or notations on bills of lading which expressly declare a defective condition of 
the goods or packaging are not acceptable.  Clauses or notations which do not expressly 
declare a defective condition of the goods or packaging (e.g., “packaging may not be 
sufficient for the sea journey”) do not constitute a discrepancy.  A statement that the 
packaging “is not sufficient for the sea journey” would not be acceptable. 
 107) 
If the word “clean” appears on a bill of lading and has been deleted, the bill of lading 
will not be deemed to be claused or unclean unless it specifically bears a clause or 
notation declaring that the goods or packaging are defective. 
 

Goods description 
108)  A goods description in the bill of lading may be shown in general terms not in conflict 
with that stated in the credit. 
 
 Corrections and alterations 
109)  Corrections and alterations on a bill of lading must be authenticated.  Such 
authentication must appear to have been made by the carrier, master (captain) or any of 
their agents (who may be different from the agent that may have issued or signed it), 
provided they are identified as an agent of the carrier or the master (captain).  
 110)  Non-negotiable copies of bills of lading do not need to include any signature on, or 
authentication of, any alterations or corrections that may have been made on the 
original. 
 
 Freight and additional costs 
111)  If a credit requires that a bill of lading show that freight has been paid or is payable at 
destination, the bill of lading must be marked accordingly. 
 112)  Applicants and issuing banks should be specific in stating the requirements of 
documents to show whether freight is to be prepaid or collected. 

113)  If a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a bill of lading must 
not indicate that costs additional to the freight have been or will be incurred.  Such 
indication may be by express reference to additional costs or by the use of shipment 
terms which refer to costs associated with the loading or unloading of goods, such as 
Free In (FI), Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out Stowed (FIOS). 
 A reference in the transport document to costs which may be levied as a result of a delay 
in unloading the goods or after the goods have been unloaded, e.g., costs covering the 
25 
late return of containers, is not considered to be an indication of additional costs in this 
context. 
 
 Goods covered by more than one bill of lading 
114)  If a bill of lading states that the goods in a container are covered by that bill of lading 
plus one or more other bills of lading, and the bill of lading states that all bills of lading 
must be surrendered, or words of similar effect, this means that all bills of lading related 
to that container must be presented in order for the container to be released. 
Such a bill 
of lading is not acceptable unless all the bills of lading form part of the same 
presentation under the same credit. 
 26 
 
CHARTER PARTY BILL OF LADING 
 
Application of UCP 600 article 22 
115)  If a credit requires presentation of a charter party bill of lading or if a credit allows 
presentation of a charter party bill of lading and a charter party bill of lading is presented 
UCP 600 article 22 is applicable.  
 116)  A transport document containing any indication that it is subject to a charter party is a 
charter party bill of lading under UCP 600 article 22. . 
 
 Full set of originals 
117) 
A UCP 600 article 22 transport document must indicate the number of originals that 
have been issued. 
Transport documents marked “First Original”, “Second Original”, 
“Third Original”, “Original”, “Duplicate”, “Triplicate”, etc. 
or similar expressions are 
all originals.  Charter party bills of lading need not be marked “original” to be acceptable 
under a credit.  In addition to UCP 600 article 17, the ICC Banking Commission Policy 
Statement, document 470/871(Rev), titled “The determination of an ‘Original’ 
document in the context of UCP 500 sub-Article 20(b)” is recommended for further 
guidance on originals and copies and remains valid under UCP 600.  The content of the 
Policy Statement appears in the Appendix of this publication, for reference purposes. 
 
 Signing of charter party bills of lading 
118)  Original charter party bills of lading must be signed in the form described in UCP 600 
sub-article 22(a)(i). 
 a. 
If the master (captain), charterer or owner signs the charter party bill of lading, 
the signature of the master (captain), charterer or owner must be identified as 
“master” (“captain”), charterer or “owner”. 
 b. 
If an agent signs the charter party bill of lading on behalf of the master (captain), 
charterer or owner, the agent must be identified as agent of the master (captain), 
charterer or owner.  In this event, the name of the master (captain) need not be 
stated, but the name of the charterer or owner must appear.  
 
 On board notations 
119) 
If a pre-printed “Shipped on board” charter party bill of lading is presented, its issuance 
date will be deemed to be the date of shipment unless it bears an on board notation, in 
which event the date of the on board notation will be deemed to be the date of shipment 
whether or not the on board date is before or after the issuance date of the document.  

120) 
“Shipped in apparent good order”, “Laden on board”, “clean on board” or other phrases 
incorporating words such as “shipped” or “on board” have the same effect as “shipped 
on board”.  
 
 Ports of loading and ports of discharge 
121)  If a credit gives a geographical area or range of ports of loading or discharge (e.g., “Any 
European Port”), the charter party bill of lading must indicate the actual port or ports of 
loading, which must be within the geographical area or range stated in the credit but 
may show the geographical area or range of ports as the port of discharge. 
 27 
 
Consignee, order party, shipper and endorsement, notify party  
122)  If a credit requires a charter party bill of lading to show that the goods are consigned to 
a named party, e.g., “consigned to Bank X” (a “straight” bill of lading), rather than “to 
order” or “to order of Bank X”, the charter party bill of lading must not contain words 
such as “to order” or “to order of” that precede the name of that named party, whether 
typed or pre-printed.  Likewise, if a credit requires the goods to be consigned “to order” 
or “to order of” a named party, the charter party bill of lading must not show that the 
goods are consigned straight to the named party. 

123)  If a charter party bill of lading is issued to order or to order of the shipper, it must be 
endorsed by the shipper.  An endorsement indicating that it is made for or on behalf of 
the shipper is acceptable. 
 124)  If a credit does not state a notify party, the respective field on the charter party bill of 
lading may be left blank or completed in any manner. 
 
 Partial shipment 
125)  If a credit prohibits partial shipments, and more than one set of original charter party 
bills of lading are presented covering shipment from one or more ports of loading (as 
specifically allowed, or within the geographical area or range stated in the credit), such 
documents are acceptable, provided that they cover the shipment of goods on the same 
vessel and same journey and are destined for the same port of discharge, range of ports 
or geographical area.  In the event that more than one set of charter party bills of lading 
are presented and incorporate different dates of shipment, the latest of these dates of 
shipment will be taken for the calculation of any presentation period and must fall on or 
before the latest shipment date specified in the credit. 
Shipment on more than one vessel 
is a partial shipment, even if the vessels leave on the same day for the same destination. 
 Clean charter party bills of lading  
126) 
Clauses or notations on charter party bills of lading which expressly declare a defective 
condition of the goods or packaging are not acceptable.  Clauses or notations that do not 
expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or packaging (e.g., “packaging 
may not be sufficient for the sea journey”) do not constitute a discrepancy.  A statement 
that the packaging “is not sufficient for the sea journey” would not be acceptable. 
 127) 
If the word “clean” appears on a charter party bill of lading and has been deleted, the 
charter party bill of lading will not be deemed to be claused or unclean unless it 
specifically bears a clause or notation declaring that the goods or packaging are 
defective.  
 Goods description  
128) 
A goods description in charter party bills of lading may be shown in general terms not 
in conflict with that stated in the credit. 
 

Corrections and Alterations 
129) 
Corrections and alterations on charter party bills of lading must be authenticated.  Such 
authentication must appear to have been made by the owner, charterer, master (captain) 
or any of their agents (who may be different from the agent that may have issued or 
28 
signed it), provided they are identified as an agent of the owner, charterer or the master 
(captain). 
 130) 
Non-negotiable copies of charter party bills of lading do not need to include any 
signature on, or authentication of, any alterations or corrections that may have been 
made on the original. 
 Freight and additional costs 
131) 
If a credit requires that a charter party bill of lading show that freight has been paid or is 
payable at destination, the charter party bill of lading must be marked accordingly. 
 132) 
Applicants and issuing banks should be specific in stating the requirements of 
documents to show whether freight is to be prepaid or collected. 
 133) 
If a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, a charter party bill of 
lading must not indicate that costs additional to the freight have been or will be 
incurred. 
Such indication may be by express reference to additional costs or by the use 
of shipment terms which refer to costs associated with the loading or unloading of 
goods, such as Free In (FI), Free Out (FO), Free In and Out (FIO) and Free In and Out 
Stowed (FIOS).  A reference in the transport document to costs which may be levied as 
a result of a delay in unloading the goods, or after the goods have been unloaded, is not 
considered to be an indication of additional costs in this context. 
 29 
 
AIR TRANSPORT DOCUMENT 
 
Application of UCP600 article 23 
134) 
If a credit requires presentation of an air transport document covering an 
airport-to-airport shipment, UCP 600 article 23 is applicable. 
 135) 
If a credit requires presentation of an “air waybill”, “air consignment note” or similar, 
UCP 600 article 23 applies.  To comply with UCP 600 article 23, an air transport 
document must appear to cover an airport-to-airport shipment but need not be titled “air 
waybill”, “air consignment note” or similar. 
 Original air transport document 
136) 
The air transport document must appear to be the original for consignor or shipper.  A 
requirement for a full set of originals is satisfied by the presentation of a document 
indicating that it is the original for consignor or shipper. 
 Signing of air transport documents 
137) 
An original air transport document must be signed in the form described in UCP 600 
sub-article 23(a)(i) and indicate the name of the carrier, identified as carrier.  If an agent 
signs an air transport document on behalf of a carrier, the agent must be identified as 
agent and must identify on whose behalf it is signing, unless the carrier has been 
identified elsewhere on the air transport document. 
 138) 
If a credit states “House air waybill is acceptable” or “Freight Forwarder’s air waybill 
is acceptable” or uses a similar phrase, then the air transport document may be signed 
by a freight forwarder in the capacity of a freight forwarder without the need to identify 
itself as a carrier or agent for a named carrier. 
In this event, it is not necessary to show 
the name of the carrier.  
 Goods accepted for carriage, date of shipment, and requirement for an actual date 
of dispatch 
139) 
An air transport document must indicate that the goods have been accepted for 
carriage. 
 140) 
The date of issuance of an air transport document is deemed to be the date of shipment 
unless the document shows a separate notation of the flight date, in which case this will 
be deemed to be the date of shipment.  Any other information appearing on the air 
transport document relative to the flight number and date will not be considered in 
determining the date of shipment.  
 Airports of departure and destination 
141) 
An air transport document must indicate the airport of departure and airport of 
destination as stated in the credit.  The identification of airports by the use of IATA 
codes instead of writing out the name in full (e.g., LHR instead of London Heathrow) is 
not a discrepancy. 
 30 
142) 
If a credit gives a geographical area or range of airports of departure or destination 
(e.g., ”Any European Airport”), the air transport document must indicate the actual 
airport of departure or destination, which must be within the geographical area or range 
stated in the credit.  

Consignee, order party and notify party 
143) 
An air transport document should not be issued “to order” or “to order of” a named 
party, because it is not a document of title.  Even if a credit calls for an air transport 
document made out “to order” or “to order of” a named party, a document presented 
showing goods consigned to that party, without mention of “to order” or “to order of”, 
is acceptable. 
 144) 
If a credit does not state a notify party, the respective field on the air transport 
document may be left blank or completed in any manner. 
 Transhipment and partial shipment 
145) 
Transhipment is the unloading from one aircraft and reloading to another aircraft 
during the carriage from the airport of departure to the airport of destination stated in 
the credit.  If it does not occur between these two airports, unloading and reloading is 
not considered to be transhipment. 
 146) 
If a credit prohibits partial shipments and more than one air transport document is 
presented covering dispatch from one or more airports of departure (as specifically 
allowed, or within the geographical area or range stated in the credit), such documents 
are acceptable, provided that they cover the dispatch of goods on the same aircraft and 
same flight and are destined for the same airport of destination.  In the event that more 
than one air transport document is presented incorporating different dates of shipment, 
the latest of these dates of shipment will be taken for the calculation of any presentation 
period and must fall on or before the latest shipment date specified in the credit. 
 147) 
Shipment on more than one aircraft is a partial shipment, even if the aircraft leave on 
the same day for the same destination. 
 Clean air transport documents  
148) 
Clauses or notations on an air transport document which expressly declare a defective 
condition of the goods or packaging are not acceptable.  Clauses or notations on the air 
transport document which do not expressly declare a defective condition of the goods or 
packaging (e.g., “packaging may not be sufficient for the air journey”) do not constitute 
a discrepancy.  A statement that the packaging “is not sufficient for the air journey” 
would not be acceptable. 
 149) 
If the word “clean” appears on an air transport document and has been deleted, the air 
transport document will not be deemed to be claused or unclean unless it specifically 
bears a clause or notation declaring that the goods or packaging are defective. 
 
 Goods description 
150) 
A goods description in an air transport document may be shown in general terms not in 
conflict with that stated in the credit. 
 

31 
Corrections and alterations 
151) 
Corrections and alterations on air transport documents must be authenticated.  Such 
authentication must appear to have been made by the carrier or any of its agents (who 
may be different from the agent that may have issued or signed it), provided it is 
identified as an agent of the carrier. 
 152) 
Copies of air transport documents do not need to include any signature of the carrier or 
agent (or shipper, even if required by the credit to appear on the original air transport 
document), nor any authentication of any alterations or corrections that may have been 
made on the original.  
 Freight and additional costs 
153) 
If a credit requires that an air transport document show that freight has been paid or is 
payable at destination, the air transport document must be marked accordingly. 
 154) 
Applicants and issuing banks should be specific in stating the requirements of 
documents to show whether freight is to be prepaid or collected. 
 155) 
If a credit states that costs additional to freight are not acceptable, an air transport 
document must not indicate that costs additional to the freight have been or will be 
incurred. 
Such indication may be by express reference to additional costs or by the use 
of shipment terms that refer to costs associated with the loading or unloading of goods. 
 A reference in the transport document to costs which may be levied as a result of a delay 
in unloading the goods or after the goods have been unloaded is not considered an 
indication of additional costs in this context.  
 156) 
Air transport documents often have separate boxes which, by their pre-printed headings, 
indicate that they are for freight charges “prepaid” and for freight charges “to collect”, 
respectively.  A requirement in a credit for an air transport document to show that freight 
has been prepaid will be fulfilled by a statement of the freight charges under the heading 
“Freight Prepaid” or a similar expression or indication, and a requirement that an air 
transport document show that freight has to be collected will be fulfilled by a statement 
of the freight charges under the heading “Freight to Collect” or a similar expression or 
indication. 

32 
 
ROAD, RAIL OR INLAND WATERWAY TRANSPORT DOCUMENTS 
 
 
Application of UCP 600 article 24  
157) 
If a credit requires presentation of a transport document covering movement by road, 
rail or inland waterway, UCP 600 article 24 is applicable. 
 Original and duplicate of road, rail or inland waterway transport documents 
158) 
If a credit requires a rail or inland waterway transport document, the transport document 
presented will be accepted as an original whether or not it is marked as an original.  A 
road transport document must appear to be the original for consignor or shipper or bear 
no marking indicating for whom the document has been prepared.  With respect to rail 
waybills, the practice of many railway companies is to provide the shipper or consignor 
with only a duplicate (often a carbon copy) duly authenticated by the railway 
company’s stamp.  Such a duplicate will be accepted as an original. 
 Carrier and signing of road, rail or inland waterway transport documents 
159) 
The term “carrier” need not appear at the signature line provided the transport document 
appears to be signed by the carrier or an agent on behalf of the carrier, if the carrier is 
otherwise identified as the “carrier” on the transport document. 
International standard 
banking practice is to accept a railway bill evidencing date stamp by the railway 
company or railway station of departure without showing the name of the carrier or a 
named agent signing for or on behalf of the carrier.  
 160)  The term “carrier” used in UCP 600 article 24 includes terms in transport documents 
such as “issuing carrier”, “actual carrier”, “succeeding carrier” and “contracting 
carrier”. 
 161) 
Any signature, stamp or notation of receipt on the transport document must appear to be 
made either by: 
a. 
the carrier, identified as the carrier or  
b. 
a named agent acting or signing for or on behalf of the carrier and indicating the 
name and capacity of the carrier on whose behalf that agent is acting or signing. 
 
 
 Order party and notify party  
162) 
Transport documents which are not documents of title should not be issued “to order” or 
“to order of” a named party.  Even if a credit calls for a transport document which is not 
a document of title to be made out “to order” or “to order of” a named party, such a 
document, showing goods consigned to that party, without mention of “to order” or “to 
order of”, is acceptable.  

163) 
If a credit does not stipulate a notify party, the respective field on the transport 
document may be left blank or completed in any manner. 
 
 33 
Partial shipment  
164) 
Shipment on more than one means of conveyance (more than one truck (lorry), train, 
vessel, etc.)  is a partial shipment, even if such means of conveyance leave on the same 
day for the same destination. 
 Goods description 
165) 
A goods description in the transport document may be shown in general terms not in 
conflict with that stated in the credit. 
 Corrections and alterations 
166) 
Corrections and alterations on a UCP 600 article 24 transport document must be 
authenticated.  Such authentication must appear to have been made by the carrier or any 
one of their named agents, who may be different from the agent that may have issued or 
signed it, provided they are identified as an agent of the carrier. 
 167) 
Copies of UCP 600 article 24 transport documents do not need to include any signature 
on, or authentication of, any alterations or corrections that may have been made on the 
original. 

Freight and additional costs 
168) 
If a credit requires that a UCP 600 article 24 transport document show that freight has 
been paid or is payable at destination, the transport document must be marked 
accordingly. 
 169) 
Applicants and issuing banks should be specific in stating the requirements of 
documents to show whether freight is to be prepaid or collected. 
 34 
 
INSURANCE DOCUMENT AND COVERAGE  
 
Application of UCP 600 article 28 
170) 
If a credit requires presentation of an insurance document such as an insurance policy, 
insurance certificate or declaration under an open cover, UCP 600 article 28 is 
applicable. 
 Issuers of insurance documents 
171) 
Insurance documents must appear to have been issued and signed by insurance 
companies or underwriters or their agents or proxies.  If required by the insurance 
document or in accordance with the credit terms, all originals must appear to have been 
countersigned. 
 172) 
An insurance document is acceptable if issued on an insurance broker’s stationery, 
provided the insurance document has been signed by an insurance company or its agent 
or proxy, or by an underwriter or its agent or proxy. 
A broker may sign as agent for the 
named insurance company or named underwriter. 
 Risks to be covered 
173) 
An insurance document must cover the risks defined in the credit.  Even though a credit 
may be explicit with regard to risks to be covered, there may be reference to exclusion 
clauses in the document.  If a credit requires “all risks” coverage, this is satisfied by the 
presentation of an insurance document evidencing any “all risks” clause or notation, 
even if it is stated that certain risks are excluded.  An insurance document indicating that 
it covers Institute Cargo Clauses (A) satisfies a condition in a credit calling for an “all 
risks” clause or notation. 
 174) 
Insurance covering the same risk for the same shipment must be covered under one 
document unless the insurance documents for partial cover each clearly reflect, by 
percentage or otherwise, the value of each insurer’s cover and that each insurer will bear 
its share of the liability severally and without pre-conditions relating to any other 
insurance cover that may have been effected for that shipment.  

Dates 
175) 
An insurance document that incorporates an expiry date must clearly indicate that such 
expiry date relates to the latest date that loading on board or dispatch or taking in charge 
of the goods (as applicable) is to occur, as opposed to an expiry date for the presentation 
of any claims thereunder. 
 Percentage and amount 
176) 
An insurance document must be issued in the currency of and, as a minimum, for the 
amount required by the credit.  The UCP does not provide for any maximum percentage 
of insurance coverage.  
 35 
177) 
If a credit requires the insurance cover to be irrespective of percentage, the insurance 
document must not contain a clause stating that the insurance cover is subject to a 
franchise or an excess deductible.  
 178) 
If it is apparent from the credit or from the documents that the final invoice amount only 
represents a certain part of the gross value of the goods (e.g., due to discounts, 
pre-payments or the like, or because part of the value of the goods is to be paid at a later 
date), the calculation of insurance cover must be based on the full gross value of the 
goods.  

Insured party and endorsement 
179) 
An insurance document must be in the form as required by the credit and, where 
necessary, be endorsed by the party to whose order claims are payable.  A document 
issued to bearer is acceptable where the credit requires an insurance document endorsed 
in blank and vice versa. 
 180) 
If a credit is silent as to the insured party, an insurance document evidencing that claims 
are payable to the order of the shipper or beneficiary would not be acceptable unless 
endorsed.  An insurance document should be issued or endorsed so that the right to 
receive payment under it passes upon, or prior to, the release of the documents. 
 36 
 
CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN  
Basic requirement 
181) 
A requirement for a certificate of origin will be satisfied by the presentation of a signed, 
dated document that certifies to the origin of the goods. 
 Issuers of certificates of origin 
182) 
A certificate of origin must be issued by the party stated in the credit.  However, if a 
credit requires a certificate of origin to be issued by the beneficiary, the exporter or the 
manufacturer, a document issued by a chamber of commerce will be deemed acceptable, 
provided it clearly identifies the beneficiary, the exporter or the manufacturer as the 
case may be. 
If a credit does not state who is to issue the certificate, then a document 
issued by any party, including the beneficiary, is acceptable. 
 Contents of certificates of origin 
183) 
The certificate of origin must appear to relate to the invoiced goods.  The goods 
description in the certificate of origin may be shown in general terms not in conflict with 
that stated in the credit or by any other reference indicating a relation to the goods in a 
required document. 
 184) 
Consignee information, if shown, must not be in conflict with the consignee information 
in the transport document.  However, if a credit requires a transport document to be 
issued “to order”, “to the order of shipper”, “to order of the issuing bank” or “consigned 
to the issuing bank”, the certificate of origin may show the applicant of the credit, or 
another party named therein, as consignee.  If a credit has been transferred, the name of 
the first beneficiary as consignee would also be acceptable. 
 185) 
The certificate of origin may show the consignor or exporter as a party other than the 
beneficiary of the credit or the shipper on the transport document.

without delay, and where payment is called for, make presentation for payment not later
than the appropriate maturity date.

 UCP 600 
UCP 600 are the latest revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice that govern the operation of letters of 
credit. 
 UCP 600 comes into effect on 01 July 2007  
The 39 articles of UCP 600 are a comprehensive and practical working aid to bankers, lawyers, importers, 
and exporters, transport executives, educators, and everyone involved in letter of credit transactions 
worldwide.  

ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600)  
Foreword  
This revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (commonly called “UCP”) is the 
sixth revision of the rules since they were first promulgated in 1933.  It is the fruit of more than three years 
of work by the International Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.  
 ICC, which was established in 1919, had as its primary objective facilitating the flow of international trade at 
a time when nationalism and protectionism posed serious threats to the world trading system.  It was in that 
spirit that the UCP were first introduced – to alleviate the confusion caused by individual countries’ 
promoting their own national rules on letter of credit practice.  The objective, since attained, was to create a 
set of contractual rules that would establish uniformity in that practice, so that practitioners would not have 
to cope with a plethora of often conflicting national regulations. 
The universal acceptance of the UCP by 
practitioners in countries with widely divergent economic and judicial systems is a testament to the rules’ 
success.  
 It is important to recall that the UCP represent the work of a private international organization, not a 
governmental body.  Since its inception, ICC has insisted on the central role of self-regulation in business 
practice.  These rules, formulated entirely by experts in the private sector, have validated that approach.  The 
UCP remain the most successful set of private rules for trade ever developed.  
 A range of individuals and groups contributed to the current revision, which is entitled UCP 600.  These 
include the UCP Drafting Group, which sifted through more than 5000 individual comments before arriving 
at this consensus text; the UCP Consulting Group, consisting of members from more than 25 countries, 
which served as the advisory body reacting to and proposing changes to the various drafts; the more than 
400 members of the ICC Commission on Banking Technique and Practice who made pertinent suggestions 
for changes in the text; and ICC national committees worldwide which took an active role in consolidating 
comments from their members. 
ICC also expresses its gratitude to practitioners in the transport and 
insurance industries, whose perceptive suggestions honed the final draft.  
 Guy Sebban  
Secretary General  
International Chamber of Commerce  
Introduction  
In May 2003, the International Chamber of Commerce authorized the ICC Commission on Banking 
Technique and Practice (Banking Commission) to begin a revision of the Uniform Customs and Practice for 
Documentary Credits, ICC Publication 500.  
 As with other revisions, the general objective was to address developments in the banking, transport and 
insurance industries.  Additionally, there was a need to look at the language and style used in the UCP to 
remove wording that could lead to inconsistent application and interpretation.  
 When work on the revision started, a number of global surveys indicated that, because of discrepancies, 
approximately 70% of documents presented under letters of credit were being rejected on first presentation. 
 This obviously had, and continues to have, a negative effect on the letter of credit being seen as a means of 
payment and, if unchecked, could have serious implications for maintaining or increasing its market share as 
a recognized means of settlement in international trade. 
The introduction by banks of a discrepancy fee has 
highlighted the importance of this issue, especially when the underlying discrepancies have been found to be 
dubious or unsound.  Whilst the number of cases involving litigation has not grown during the lifetime of UCP 
500, the introduction of the ICC’s Documentary Credit Dispute Resolution Expertise Rules (DOCDEX) in 
October 1997 (subsequently revised in March 2002) has resulted in more than 60 cases being decided.  
 To address these and other concerns, the Banking Commission established a Drafting Group to revise UCP 
500.  It was also decided to create a second group, known as the Consulting Group, to review and advise on 
early drafts submitted by the Drafting Group.  The Consulting Group, made up of over 40 individuals from 26 
countries, consisted of banking and transport industry experts.  Ably co-chaired by John Turnbull, Deputy 
General Manager, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation Europe Ltd, London and Carlo Di Ninni, Adviser, 
Italian Bankers Association, Rome, the Consulting Group provided valuable input to the Drafting Group prior 
to release of draft texts to ICC national committees.  

The Drafting Group began the review process by analyzing the content of the official Opinions issued by the 
Banking Commission under UCP 500.  Some 500 Opinions were reviewed to assess whether the issues 
involved warranted a change in, an addition to or a deletion of any UCP article.  In addition, consideration 
was given to the content of the four Position Papers issued by the Commission in September 1994, the two 
Decisions issued by the Commission (concerning the introduction of the euro and the determination of what 
constituted an original document under UCP 500 sub-article 20(b) and the decisions issued in DOCDEX 
cases.  
 During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been completed in creating 
the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits 
(ISBP), ICC Publication 645.  This publication has evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for 
determining compliance of documents with the terms of letters of credit. 
It is the expectation of the Drafting 
Group and the Banking Commission that the application of the principles contained in the ISBP, including 
subsequent revisions thereof, will continue during the time UCP 600 is in force.  At the time UCP 600 is 
implemented, there will be an updated version of the ISBP to bring its contents in line with the substance 
and style of the new rules.  
 The four Position Papers issued in September 1994 were issued subject to their application under UCP 500; 
therefore, they will not be applicable under UCP 600.  The essence of the Decision covering the 
determination of an original document has been incorporated into the text of UCP 600.  The outcome of the 
DOCDEX cases were invariably based on existing ICC Banking Commission Opinions and therefore contained 
no specific issues that required addressing in these rules.  
 One of the structural changes to the UCP is the introduction of articles covering definitions (article 2) and 
interpretations (article 3). 
In providing definitions of roles played by banks and the meaning of specific 
terms and events, UCP 600 avoids the necessity of repetitive text to explain their interpretation and 
application.  Similarly, the article covering interpretations aims to take the ambiguity out of vague or unclear 
language that appears in letters of credit and to provide a definitive elucidation of other characteristics of 
the UCP or the credit.  
 During the course of the last three years, ICC national committees were canvassed on a range of issues to 
determine their preferences on alternative texts submitted by the Drafting Group.  The results of this 
exercise and the considerable input from national committees on individual items in the text is reflected in 
the content of UCP 600.  The Drafting Group considered, not only the current practice relative to the 
documentary credit, but also tried to envisage the future evolution of that practice.  
 This revision of the UCP represents the culmination of over three years of extensive analysis, review, debate 
and compromise amongst the various members of the Drafting Group, the members of the Banking 
Commission and the respective ICC national committees. 
Valuable comment has also been received from 
the ICC Commission on Transport and Logistics, the Commission on Commercial Law and Practice and the 
Committee on Insurance.  
 It is not appropriate for this publication to provide an explanation as to why an article has been worded in 
such a way or what is intended by its incorporation into the rules.  For those interested in understanding the 
rationale and interpretation of the articles of UCP 600, this information will be found in the Commentary to 
the rules, ICC Publication 601, which represents the Drafting Group’s views.  
 On behalf of the Drafting Group I would like to extend our deep appreciation to the members of the 
Consulting Group, ICC national committees and members of the Banking Commission for their professional 
comments and their constructive participation in this process.  
 Special thanks are due to the members of the Drafting Group and their institutions, who are listed below in

UCP 600 - Article 1 
Application of UCP 
The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, 2007 Revision, ICC Publication no.  600 ("UCP") 
are rules that apply to any documentary credit ("credit") (including, to the extent to which they may be 
applicable, any standby letter of credit) when the text of the credit expressly indicates that it is subject to 
these rules.  They are binding on all parties thereto unless expressly modified or excluded by the credit.  
 UCP 600 - Article 2 
Definitions 
For the purpose of these rules:  
Advising bank means the bank that advises the credit at the request of the issuing bank. 
 Applicant means the party on whose request the credit is issued. 
 Banking day means a day on which a bank is regularly open at the place at which an act subject to these 
rules is to be performed. 

Beneficiary means the party in whose favour a credit is issued. 
 Complying presentation means a presentation that is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
credit, the applicable provisions of these rules and international standard banking practice. 
 Confirmation means a definite undertaking of the confirming bank, in addition to that of the issuing bank, 
to honour or negotiate a complying presentation. 
 Confirming bank means the bank that adds its confirmation to a credit upon the issuing bank's 
authorization or request.  
 Credit means any arrangement, however named or described, that is irrevocable and thereby constitutes a 
definite undertaking of the issuing bank to honour a complying presentation. 
 Honour means: 
a. to pay at sight if the credit is available by sight payment. 
 b. to incur a deferred payment undertaking and pay at maturity if the credit is available by deferred 
payment. 
 c. to accept a bill of exchange ("draft") drawn by the beneficiary and pay at maturity if the credit is available 
by acceptance. 

Issuing bank means the bank that issues a credit at the request of an applicant or on its own behalf. 
 Negotiation means the purchase by the nominated bank of drafts (drawn on a bank other than the 
nominated bank) and/or documents under a complying presentation, by advancing or agreeing to advance 
funds to the beneficiary on or before the banking day on which reimbursement is due to the nominated 
bank. 
 Nominated Bank means the bank with which the credit is available or any bank in the case of a credit 
available with any bank. 
 Presentation means either the delivery of documents under a credit to the issuing bank or nominated bank 
or the documents so delivered.  
 Presenter means a beneficiary, bank or other party that makes a presentation. 
 UCP 600 - Article 3 
Interpretations 
For the purpose of these rules: 
Where applicable, words in the singular include the plural and in the plural include the singular. 
 A credit is irrevocable even if there is no indication to that effect. 
 A document may be signed by handwriting, facsimile signature, perforated signature, stamp, symbol or any 
other mechanical or electronic method of authentication. 
 A requirement for a document to be legalized, visaed, certified or similar will be satisfied by any signature, 
mark, stamp or label on the document which appears to satisfy that requirement. 

Branches of a bank in different countries are considered to be separate banks.  
 Terms such as "first class", "well known", "qualified", "independent", "official", "competent" or "local" used 
to describe the issuer of a document allow any issuer except the beneficiary to issue that document. 
 Unless required to be used in a document, words such as "prompt", "immediately" or "as soon as possible" 
will be disregarded. 
 The expression "on or about" or similar will be interpreted as a stipulation that an event is to occur during a 
period of five calendar days before until five calendar days after the specified date, both start and end dates 
included. 
 The words "to", "until", "till", "from" and "between" when used to determine a period of shipment include 
the date or dates mentioned, and the words "before" and "after" exclude the date mentioned.  
 The words "from" and "after" when used to determine a maturity date exclude the date mentioned.  
 The terms "first half" and "second half" of a month shall be construed respectively as the 1st to the 15th and 
the 16th to the last day of the month, all dates inclusive.  
 The terms "beginning", "middle" and "end" of a month shall be construed respectively as the 1st to the 
10th, the 11th to the 20th and the 21st to the last day of the month, all dates inclusive.  

UCP 600 - Article 4 
Credits v. Contracts  
a. A credit by its nature is a separate transaction from the sale or other contract on which it may be based. 
 Banks are in no way concerned with or bound by such contract, even if any reference whatsoever to it is 
included in the credit.  Consequently, the undertaking of a bank to honour, to negotiate or to fulfil any other 
obligation under the credit is not subject to claims or defences by the applicant resulting from its 
relationships with the issuing bank or the beneficiary.  
 A beneficiary can in no case avail itself of the contractual relationships existing between banks or between 
the applicant and the issuing bank. 
 b. An issuing bank should discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an integral part of the 
credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice and the like. 
 UCP 600 - Article 5 
Documents v. Goods, Services or Performance 
Banks deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the documents may 
relate. 

UCP 600 - Article 6 
Availability, Expiry Date and Place for Presentation 
a. A credit must state the bank with which it is available or whether it is available with any bank.  A credit 
available with a nominated bank is also available with the issuing bank. 
 b. A credit must state whether it is available by sight payment, deferred payment, acceptance or 
negotiation. 
 c. A credit must not be issued available by a draft drawn on the applicant. 
 d. 
i. A credit must state an expiry date for presentation.  An expiry date stated for honour or negotiation will be 
deemed to be an expiry date for presentation. 
 ii.  The place of the bank with which the credit is available is the place for presentation.  The place for 
presentation under a credit available with any bank is that of any bank.  A place for presentation other than 
that of the issuing bank is in addition to the place of the issuing bank.

 UCP 600 - Article 7 
Issuing Bank Undertaking  
a. Provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the nominated bank or to the issuing bank and 
that they constitute a complying presentation, the issuing bank must honour if the credit is available by: 
i. sight payment, deferred payment or acceptance with the issuing bank;  
ii.  sight payment with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not pay;  
iii.  deferred payment with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not incur its deferred payment 
undertaking or, having incurred its deferred payment undertaking, does not pay at maturity;  
iv.  acceptance with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not accept a draft drawn on it or, 
having accepted a draft drawn on it, does not pay at maturity; 
v. negotiation with a nominated bank and that nominated bank does not negotiate.  

b. An issuing bank is irrevocably bound to honour as of the time it issues the credit.  
 c. An issuing bank undertakes to reimburse a nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a complying 
presentation and forwarded the documents to the issuing bank.  Reimbursement for the amount of a 
complying presentation under a credit available by acceptance or deferred payment is due at maturity, 
whether or not the nominated bank prepaid or purchased before maturity.  An issuing bank's undertaking to 
reimburse a nominated bank is independent of the issuing bank's undertaking to the beneficiary. 
 UCP 600 - Article 8 
Confirming Bank Undertaking 
a. Provided that the stipulated documents are presented to the confirming bank or to any other nominated 
bank and that they constitute a complying presentation, the confirming bank must:  
i. honour, if the credit is available by 
a. sight payment, deferred payment or acceptance with the confirming bank; 
b. sight payment with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not pay; 
c. deferred payment with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not incur its deferred 
payment undertaking or, having incurred its deferred payment undertaking, does not pay at maturity; 
d. acceptance with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not accept a draft drawn on it 
or, having accepted a draft drawn on it, does not pay at maturity; 
e. negotiation with another nominated bank and that nominated bank does not negotiate. 

ii. 
negotiate, without recourse, if the credit is available by negotiation with the confirming bank.  
 b. A confirming bank is irrevocably bound to honour or negotiate as of the time it adds its confirmation to 
the credit.  
 c. A confirming bank undertakes to reimburse another nominated bank that has honoured or negotiated a 
complying presentation and forwarded the documents to the confirming bank.  Reimbursement for the 
amount of a complying presentation under a credit available by acceptance or deferred payment is due at 
maturity, whether or not another nominated bank prepaid or purchased before maturity.  A confirming 
bank's undertaking to reimburse another nominated bank is independent of the confirming bank's 
undertaking to the beneficiary. 
 d. If a bank is authorized or requested by the issuing bank to confirm a credit but is not prepared to do so, 
it must inform the issuing bank without delay and may advise the credit without confirmation. 
 UCP 600 - Article 9 
Advising of Credits and Amendments  
a. A credit and any amendment may be advised to a beneficiary through an advising bank. 
An advising bank 
that is not a confirming bank advises the credit and any amendment without any undertaking to honour or 
negotiate.  
 b. By advising the credit or amendment, the advising bank signifies that it has satisfied itself as to the 
apparent authenticity of the credit or amendment and that the advice accurately reflects the terms and 
conditions of the credit or amendment received.  
 c. An advising bank may utilize the services of another bank ("second advising bank") to advise the credit 
and any amendment to the beneficiary.  By advising the credit or amendment, the second advising bank 
signifies that it has satisfied itself as to the apparent authenticity of the advice it has received and that the 
advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the credit or amendment received.  
 d. A bank utilizing the services of an advising bank or second advising bank to advise a credit must use the 
same bank to advise any amendment thereto.  
 e. If a bank is requested to advise a credit or amendment but elects not to do so, it must so inform, without 
delay, the bank from which the credit, amendment or advice has been received.  

f. If a bank is requested to advise a credit or amendment but cannot satisfy itself as to the apparent 
authenticity of the credit, the amendment or the advice, it must so inform, without delay, the bank from 
which the instructions appear to have been received.  If the advising bank or second advising bank elects 
nonetheless to advise the credit or amendment, it must inform the beneficiary or second advising bank that 
it has not been able to satisfy itself as to the apparent authenticity of the credit, the amendment or the 
advice. 
 UCP 600 - Article 10 
Amendments 
a. Except as otherwise provided by article 38, a credit can neither be amended nor cancelled without the 
agreement of the issuing bank, the confirming bank, if any, and the beneficiary.  
 b. An issuing bank is irrevocably bound by an amendment as of the time it issues the amendment.  A 
confirming bank may extend its confirmation to an amendment and will be irrevocably bound as of the time 
it advises the amendment.  A confirming bank may, however, choose to advise an amendment without 
extending its confirmation and, if so, it must inform the issuing bank without delay and inform the 
beneficiary in its advice.  

c. The terms and conditions of the original credit (or a credit incorporating previously accepted 
amendments) will remain in force for the beneficiary until the beneficiary communicates its acceptance of 
the amendment to the bank that advised such amendment.  The beneficiary should give notification of 
acceptance or rejection of an amendment.  If the beneficiary fails to give such notification, a presentation 
that complies with the credit and to any not yet accepted amendment will be deemed to be notification of 
acceptance by the beneficiary of such amendment.  As of that moment the credit will be amended. 
 d. A bank that advises an amendment should inform the bank from which it received the amendment of any 
notification of acceptance or rejection.  
 e. Partial acceptance of an amendment is not allowed and will be deemed to be notification of rejection of 
the amendment.  
 f. A provision in an amendment to the effect that the amendment shall enter into force unless rejected by 
the beneficiary within a certain time shall be disregarded. 

UCP 600 - Article 11 
Teletransmitted and Pre-Advised Credits and Amendments  
a. An authenticated teletransmission of a credit or amendment will be deemed to be the operative credit or 
amendment, and any subsequent mail confirmation shall be disregarded.  
 If a teletransmission states "full details to follow" (or words of similar effect), or states that the mail 
confirmation is to be the operative credit or amendment, then the teletransmission will not be deemed to be 
the operative credit or amendment.  The issuing bank must then issue the operative credit or amendment 
without delay in terms not inconsistent with the teletransmission.  
 b. A preliminary advice of the issuance of a credit or amendment ("pre-advice") shall only be sent if the 
issuing bank is prepared to issue the operative credit or amendment.  An issuing bank that sends a pre-
advice is irrevocably committed to issue the operative credit or amendment, without delay, in terms not 
inconsistent with the pre-advice. 

UCP 600 - Article 12 
Nomination 
a. Unless a nominated bank is the confirming bank, an authorization to honour or negotiate does not impose 
any obligation on that nominated bank to honour or negotiate, except when expressly agreed to by that 
nominated bank and so communicated to the beneficiary.  
 b. By nominating a bank to accept a draft or incur a deferred payment undertaking, an issuing bank 
authorizes that nominated bank to prepay or purchase a draft accepted or a deferred payment undertaking 
incurred by that nominated bank.  
 c. Receipt or examination and forwarding of documents by a nominated bank that is not a confirming bank 
does not make that nominated bank liable to honour or negotiate, nor does it constitute honour or 
negotiation. 
 UCP 600 - Article 13 
Bank-to-Bank Reimbursement Arrangements 
a. If a credit states that reimbursement is to be obtained by a nominated bank ("claiming bank") claiming 
on another party ("reimbursing bank"), the credit must state if the reimbursement is subject to the ICC 
rules for bank-to-bank reimbursements in effect on the date of issuance of the credit.  

b. If a credit does not state that reimbursement is subject to the ICC rules for bank-to-bank 
reimbursements, the following apply:  
i.An issuing bank must provide a reimbursing bank with a reimbursement authorization that conforms with 
the availability stated in the credit.  The reimbursement authorization should not be subject to an expiry 
date.  
 ii.A claiming bank shall not be required to supply a reimbursing bank with a certificate of compliance with 
the terms and conditions of the credit.  
 iii.An issuing bank will be responsible for any loss of interest, together with any expenses incurred, if 
reimbursement is not provided on first demand by a reimbursing bank in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the credit.  
 iv.A reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the issuing bank.  However, if the charges are for the 
account of the beneficiary, it is the responsibility of an issuing bank to so indicate in the credit and in the 
reimbursement authorization.  If a reimbursing bank's charges are for the account of the beneficiary, they 
shall be deducted from the amount due to a claiming bank when reimbursement is made. 
If no 
reimbursement is made, the reimbursing bank's charges remain the obligation of the issuing bank.  
 c. An issuing bank is not relieved of any of its obligations to provide reimbursement if reimbursement is not 
made by a reimbursing bank on first demand. 
 UCP 600 - Article 14

have a maximum of five banking days following the day of presentation to determine if a presentation is

 c. A presentation including one or more original transport documents subject to articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 
24 or 25 must be made by or on behalf of the beneficiary not later than 21 calendar days after the date of 
shipment as described in these rules, but in any event not later than the expiry date of the credit.  
 d. Data in a document, when read in context with the credit, the document itself and international standard 
banking practice, need not be identical to, but must not conflict with, data in that document, any other 
stipulated document or the credit. 
 e. In documents other than the commercial invoice, the description of the goods, services or performance, if 
stated, may be in general terms not conflicting with their description in the credit. 
 f. If a credit requires presentation of a document other than a transport document, insurance document or 
commercial invoice, without stipulating by whom the document is to be issued or its data content, banks will 
accept the document as presented if its content appears to fulfil the function of the required document and 
otherwise complies with sub-article 14 (d).  
 g. A document presented but not required by the credit will be disregarded and may be returned to the 
presenter.  
 h. If a credit contains a condition without stipulating the document to indicate compliance with the 
condition, banks will deem such condition as not stated and will disregard it.

date of presentation.  
 j. When the addresses of the beneficiary and the applicant appear in any stipulated document, they need

same country as the respective addresses mentioned in the credit.  Contact details (telefax, telephone, email 
and the like) stated as part of the beneficiary's and the applicant's address will be disregarded.  However, 
when the address and contact details of the applicant appear as part of the consignee or notify party details 
on a transport document subject to articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25, they must be as stated in the 
credit.  
 k. The shipper or consignor of the goods indicated on any document need not be the beneficiary of the 
credit. 
 l. A transport document may be issued by any party other than a carrier, owner, master or charterer 
provided that the transport document meets the requirements of articles 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 or 24 of these 
rules.

determines that a presentation does not comply, it may refuse to honour or negotiate.  
 b. When an issuing bank determines that a presentation does not comply, it may in its sole judgement 
approach the applicant for a waiver of the discrepancies.  This does not, however, extend the period 
mentioned in sub-article 14 (b).

providing notice required by sub-article 16 (c) (iii) (a) or (b), return the documents to the presenter at any

If the presentation consists of more than 
one set of transport documents, the latest date of shipment as evidenced on any of the sets of transport 
documents will be regarded as the date of shipment.

one means of conveyance within the same mode of transport will be regarded as covering a partial 
shipment, even if the means of conveyance leave on the same day for the same destination. 
 c. A presentation consisting of more than one courier receipt, post receipt or certificate of posting will not be 
regarded as a partial shipment if the courier receipts, post receipts or certificates of posting appear to have 
been stamped or signed by the same courier or postal service at the same place and date and for the same 
destination. 
 UCP 600 - Article 32 
Instalment Drawings or Shipments

legal effect of any document, or for the general or particular conditions stipulated in a document or 
superimposed thereon; nor does it assume any liability or responsibility for the description, quantity, weight, 
quality, condition, packing, delivery, value or existence of the goods, services or other performance 
represented by any document, or for the good faith or acts or omissions, solvency, performance or standing 
of the consignor, the carrier, the forwarder, the consignee or the insurer of the goods or any other person. 
 UCP 600 - Article 35 
Disclaimer on Transmission and Translation  
A bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the consequences arising out of delay, loss in transit, 
mutilation or other errors arising in the transmission of any messages or delivery of letters or documents, 
when such messages, letters or documents are transmitted or sent according to the requirements stated in 
the credit, or when the bank may have taken the initiative in the choice of the delivery service in the 
absence of such instructions in the credit.  

If a nominated bank determines that a presentation is complying and forwards the documents to the issuing 
bank or confirming bank, whether or not the nominated bank has honoured or negotiated, an issuing bank 
or confirming bank must honour or negotiate, or reimburse that nominated bank, even when the documents 
have been lost in transit between the nominated bank and the issuing bank or confirming bank, or between 
the confirming bank and the issuing bank.  
 A bank assumes no liability or responsibility for errors in translation or interpretation of technical terms and 
may transmit credit terms without translating them. 
 UCP 600 - Article 36 
Force Majeure 
A bank assumes no liability or responsibility for the consequences arising out of the interruption of its 
business by Acts of God, riots, civil commotions, insurrections, wars, acts of terrorism, or by any strikes or

 b. An issuing bank or advising bank assumes no liability or responsibility should the instructions it transmits 
to another bank not be carried out, even if it has taken the initiative in the choice of that other bank.  
 c. A bank instructing another bank to perform services is liable for any commissions, fees, costs or expenses 
("charges") incurred by that bank in connection with its instructions.  
 If a credit states that charges are for the account of the beneficiary and charges cannot be collected or 
deducted from proceeds, the issuing bank remains liable for payment of charges.  
 A credit or amendment should not stipulate that the advising to a beneficiary is conditional upon the receipt 
by the advising bank or second advising bank of its charges.  

d. The applicant shall be bound by and liable to indemnify a bank against all obligations and responsibilities 
imposed by foreign laws and usages. 
 UCP 600 - Article 38 
Transferable Credits 
a. A bank is under no obligation to transfer a credit except to the extent and in the manner expressly 
consented to by that bank. 
 b. For the purpose of this article: 
Transferable credit means a credit that specifically states it is "transferable".  A transferable credit may be 
made available in whole or in part to another beneficiary ("second beneficiary") at the request of the 
beneficiary ("first beneficiary").  
 Transferring bank means a nominated bank that transfers the credit or, in a credit available with any bank, 
a bank that is specifically authorized by the issuing bank to transfer and that transfers the credit.  An issuing 
bank may be a transferring bank.  
 Transferred credit means a credit that has been made available by the transferring bank to a second 
beneficiary. 
 c. Unless otherwise agreed at the time of transfer, all charges (such as commissions, fees, costs or 
expenses) incurred in respect of a transfer must be paid by the first beneficiary.  

d. A credit may be transferred in part to more than one second beneficiary provided partial drawings or 
shipments are allowed.  
 A transferred credit cannot be transferred at the request of a second beneficiary to any subsequent 
beneficiary.  The first beneficiary is not considered to be a subsequent beneficiary.  
 e. Any request for transfer must indicate if and under what conditions amendments may be advised to the 
second beneficiary.  The transferred credit must clearly indicate those conditions.  
 f. If a credit is transferred to more than one second beneficiary, rejection of an amendment by one or more 
second beneficiary does not invalidate the acceptance by any other second beneficiary, with respect to 
which the transferred credit will be amended accordingly.  For any second beneficiary that rejected the 
amendment, the transferred credit will remain unamended.  
 g. The transferred credit must accurately reflect the terms and conditions of the credit, including 
confirmation, if any, with the exception of:  
- the amount of the credit, 
- any unit price stated therein, 
- the expiry date, 
- the period for presentation, or 
- the latest shipment date or given period for shipment,  
any or all of which may be reduced or curtailed.  

The percentage for which insurance cover must be effected may be increased to provide the amount of 
cover stipulated in the credit or these articles.  
 The name of the first beneficiary may be substituted for that of the applicant in the credit. 
 If the name of the applicant is specifically required by the credit to appear in any document other than the 
invoice, such requirement must be reflected in the transferred credit.  
 h. The first beneficiary has the right to substitute its own invoice and draft, if any, for those of a second 
beneficiary for an amount not in excess of that stipulated in the credit, and upon such substitution the first 
beneficiary can draw under the credit for the difference, if any, between its invoice and the invoice of a 
second beneficiary. 
 i. If the first beneficiary is to present its own invoice and draft, if any, but fails to do so on first demand, or 
if the invoices presented by the first beneficiary create discrepancies that did not exist in the presentation 
made by the second beneficiary and the first beneficiary fails to correct them on first demand, the 
transferring bank has the right to present the documents as received from the second beneficiary to the 
issuing bank, without further responsibility to the first beneficiary.  

j. The first beneficiary may, in its request for transfer, indicate that honour or negotiation is to be effected 
to a second beneficiary at the place to which the credit has been transferred, up to and including the expiry 
date of the credit.  This is without prejudice to the right of the first beneficiary in accordance with sub-article 
38 (h).  
 k. Presentation of documents by or on behalf of a second beneficiary must be made to the transferring 
bank. 
 UCP 600 - Article 39 
Assignment of Proceeds  
The fact that a credit is not stated to be transferable shall not affect the right of the beneficiary to assign 
any proceeds to which it may be or may become entitled under the credit, in accordance with the provisions 
of applicable law.  This article relates only to the assignment of proceeds and not to the assignment of the 
right to perform under the credit.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.
 [

Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.

Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.
 [

]
Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.

Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.
 [

]
Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

Trade finance
is a phrase used to describe different strategies that are employed to make international trade easier. 
It signifies financing for trade, and it concerns both domestic and international trade transactions.  A trade transaction requires a seller of goods and services as well as a buyer.  Various intermediaries such as
banks
and
financial institutions
can facilitate these transactions by financing the trade.  Trade finance manifests itself in the form of letters of credit (LOC), guarantees, or insurance, and is usually provided by intermediaries.

Description
[
edit
]
While a seller (or
exporter
) can require the purchaser (an
importer
) to prepay for goods
shipped
, the purchaser (importer) may wish to reduce risk by requiring the seller to document the goods that have been shipped.
 Banks
may assist by providing various forms of support.  For example, the importer's bank may provide a
letter of credit
to the exporter (or the exporter's bank) providing for payment upon presentation of certain documents, such as a
bill of lading
.  The exporter's bank may make a loan (by advancing funds) to the exporter on the basis of the export contract.

Other forms of trade finance can include export finance,
documentary collection
,
trade credit insurance
,
fine trading
,
factoring
,
supply chain finance
, or
forfaiting
.  Some forms are specifically designed to supplement traditional financing.
 Export finance
- When an exporter’s operating cycle (length of time it takes to sell its inventory and collect on its sales) exceeds the credit terms extended by its trade creditors (suppliers), the exporter has a financing requirement.  Export finance is needed to cover the gap between when an exporter is able to turn inventory and trade receivables to cash and when it has to pay on its trade payables.

]
Secure trade finance depends on verifiable and secure tracking of physical risks and events in the chain between exporter and importer.  The advent of new information and communication technologies allows the development of risk mitigation models which have developed into advance finance models.  This allows very low risk of advance payment given to the Exporter, while preserving the Importer's normal payment credit terms and without burdening the importer's
balance sheet
. 
As trade transactions become more flexible and increase in volume, demand for these technologies has grown.
 Products and services
[
edit
]
Banks and financial institutions offer the following products and services in their trade finance branches.
 Letter of credit
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank/Financial Institution on behalf of the Buyer/Importer to the Seller/Exporter, that, if the Seller/Exporter presents the complying documents to the Buyer's designated Bank/Financial Institution as specified by the Buyer/Importer in the Purchase Agreement then the Buyer's Bank/Financial Institution will make payment to the Seller/Exporter.
 Bank guarantee
: It is an undertaking/promise given by a Bank on behalf of the Applicant and in favour of the Beneficiary.  Whereas, the Bank has agreed and undertakes that, if the Applicant failed to fulfill his obligations either Financial or Performance as per the Agreement made between the Applicant and the Beneficiary, then the Guarantor Bank on behalf of the Applicant will make payment of the guarantee amount to the Beneficiary upon receipt of a demand or claim from the Beneficiary.

Bank guarantee has various types like
1.  Tender Bond
2.  Advance Payment
3.  Performance Bond
4.  Financial
5.  Retention
6. 
Labour
7. ready for basic analysis
Export
Import
Collection and discounting of bills: It is a major trade service offered by the Banks.  The Seller's Bank collects the payment proceeds on behalf of the Seller, from the Buyer or Buyer's Bank, for the goods sold by the Seller to the Buyer as per the agreement made between the Seller and the Buyer.
 Supply Chain intermediaries have expanded in recent years to offer importers a funded transaction of individual trades from foreign supplier to importers warehouse or customers designated point of receipt.  The Supply Chain products offer importers a funded transaction based on customer order book.
 Methods of payment
[
edit
]
Popular methods of
payment
used in
international trade
include:
Advance payment
- the buyer arranges for their bank to pay the supplier around 30% of the order value upfront when ordering, and the other 70% when the goods are released or shipped.
 Letter of credit (L/C)
- this document gives the seller two guarantees that the payment will be made by the buyer :one guarantee from the buyer's
bank
and another from the seller's bank.

Bills for collection (B/E or D/C)
- here a
bill of exchange
(B/E) is used; or documentary collection (D/C) which is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment.
 Open account
- this method can be used by
business partners
who trust each other; the two partners need to have their accounts with the banks that are
correspondent banks
.
 Bill of exchange
- is used in international trade to bind one party to pay a fixed amount of money to another party on demand date or at certain point in future.
 Documentary Credit
- Similar to LCs, documentary credits provide assurance of payment to the seller.  However, unlike LCs, they are issued by financial institutions other than banks.
 Priority payment
- in this method funds are being transmitted through secure inter- bank computer network known as
SWIFT
(Society for Worldwide Inter- bank Financial Telecommunication) or by fax.

 What is a Letter of Credit (LC)?
 Letters of credit (also know as documentary credits) are payment instruments that constitute a definite undertaking of the issuer (“the issuing bank”) on the instruction of the buyer (“applicant”) to pay a certain specified amount to a seller (“the beneficiary”) at sight or on a future determinable date (“the maturity date”) provided that documents stipulated in the letter of credit/documentary credit are presented in compliance with the stated terms and conditions.
 The issuing bank issues the documentary credit on behalf of its customer (“the applicant”) or on its own behalf.
 These undertakings are known as “documentary credits”, as they specify the documents that must be presented in order for the credit to be honoured.
 These are also known as “letters of credit” (LCs) as they were originally issued in a physical document form addressed to the beneficiary with the issuing bank’s undertaking to pay upon receipt of complying documents.
 There are several critical features of documentary credits/letters of credit:
Irrevocability
: documentary credits constitute an irrevocable undertaking of the issuer to pay, meaning that, once issued, the credit cannot be revoked or changed by the issuing bank. 
A credit can only be amended or cancelled with the consent of the issuing bank, the beneficiary, and the confirming bank (if any).
 Documentary nature
: documentary credits are documentary in nature and any payment undertakings contained in them are conditional upon receipt of documents as stated in the terms and conditions of the credit.
 Compliance
: documentary credits are settled only when the documents presented by or on behalf of the beneficiary comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.  Therefore, to obtain payment under a documentary credit, the beneficiary must present documents which comply with each credit’s terms & conditions.  If the documents contained do not comply (also known as discrepancies), an issuing bank may refuse to honour and is only obligated to pay if the non-complying documents are corrected and made compliant before the credit expires, or if the applicant waives the discrepancies and the issuing bank also agrees to waive any discrepancy(ies).

Payment mechanism
: documentary credits constitute a payment mechanism designed to facilitate the settlement of an underlying trade transaction whereby the applicant (the buyer) receives the goods or services, and the beneficiary (the seller) obtains payment via the credit which would then satisfy the applicant’s payment obligations against the underlying sales or other contract on which it may be based.
 Independence and autonomy
: documentary credits constitute an independent undertaking of the issuing bank and the confirming bank (if any) separate from the underlying sale or other contract on which it may be based.  The principle of autonomy is articulated within the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 2007 Revision (“UCP 600”) and is upheld throughout the world.
 Purpose
The purpose of a documentary credit is to provide a mechanism or arrangement to facilitate the settlement of an international or domestic trade transaction by use of a bank undertaking.
 It should be noted that banks only deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the documents may relate.

The terms and conditions of a documentary credit form the basis upon which the applicant must reimburse an issuing bank when a complying presentation is made.
 Documentary credits assure the beneficiary of payment as long as they present the requisite complying documents to the nominated bank, the confirming bank (if any), or the issuing bank.

 Frequently Asked Questions
How do you use a Letter of Credit?
 Letters of Credit are issued and formatted under the guidelines of the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits, or the
UCP600
, that is issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  Using one is fairly straightforward, both for businesses selling and those buying goods and services.
 One of the parties, usually the importer, will contact a bank to serve as an intermediary and to guarantee to the seller that the goods will be paid for according to the agreement.  All parties involved need to agree to the terms and sign the contract. 
This lowers the risk of doing business significantly, as Letters of Credit are legally binding documents that are acknowledged by 175 countries worldwide.
 Check the documents carefully
Although the guidelines and the form of any LC are largely the same, the content is not.  It is crucial that both the buyer and the seller inspect the documents carefully and check for errors and mistakes that may end up in delays, further costs, or deferred payment.  Even a minor oversight can be quite costly in this regard, and it is advisable to use several sets of eyes to check the documents.
 Letter of Credit terms include:
Advising bank
– accepts and then notifies the beneficiary of the LC
Confirming bank
– financial institution that agrees to honour and payment the LC to the beneficiary and receives payment from the advising bank
Irrevocable
– A non-amendable LC, unless agreed by all parties
Issuing bank / issuer
– the party that issues the LC
Presentation
– delivery of the LC documentation and any other required documents that are required by the beneficiary should payment be made / the LC honoured
Revocable
– a type of LC that can be withdrawn, amended or cancelled by the issuing party at any time
Standby
– the most common LC type whereby agreement to pay is made under certain conditions
Who should use a Letter of Credit?

Letters of Credit are useful to any business that trades in large volumes, both domestically, and cross-border.  They are important to ensure the cash flow of a company and lowers the risk of default due to non-payment from the end customer.
 Additionally, a LC can benefit companies that structure their business around e-Commerce or services.
 When deciding whether or not to request a LC, some considerations might include:
The costs associated versus the risk of non-payment, as well as which party will incur these costs
Legal requirements and expertise required
Documentation needed (for proof of delivery, sending the goods across e.g.  customs declaration and insurance documents)
The supplier / customers creditworthiness
Overseas Business
International traders or wholesale producers of goods are the primary users of LC.  These types of company need to be certain that they will not suffer losses from selling to overseas buyers that they are unfamiliar with.
 In the unfortunate case that the recipient of the goods is unwilling or unable to pay the seller, the LC is activated, and under the terms of the agreement, the bank will be obliged to cover the missing payment. 
After the intermediary completes the payment, the bank will deal with the buyer according to the domestic law of the country where the buyer is located.
 Online Business
Online,
e-commerce
and service businesses often use LC for overseas contracts.  For companies producing software, or other online services that demand the employment of significant resource, it is important to consider external finance to free up working capital.
 Small and Medium Enterprises
Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for 99% of businesses.  Letters of Credit can help alleviate some of the cash flow constraints stemming from delayed and long payment terms from end customers.  Large international companies are often culprits for late payments to SMEs, which can often put small companies at financial strain, or even out of business.
 What are the benefits of using a Letter of Credit?
 Risk and trust are one of the major challenges when it comes to trade, be that domestic or international.  The specificity and legal weight of LC are a big advantage, given that they are accepted and acknowledged by 175 countries, reduce the risk of doing business overseas, and provide transparent collaboration between unknown parties.

Finally, Letters of Credit provide better clarity on the transaction, as all of the goods or services supplied would be defined in detail.  This provides additional comfort to the buyer as well as removing the possibility that the descriptions of the goods ordered are vastly different from what arrives.
 Key advantages:
Avoids potential disputes overseas
Some form of guarantee to a seller / supplier that they will get paid
Flexibility and variability across different types of LCs
Secure payment method endorsed by most major markets
Risk of non-payment is taken by the banks rather than the buyer
Often required by national border / exchange control agencies
How can a Letter of Credit help your business grow?
 Using Letters of Credit can significantly advantage your business, regardless if you are a seller or buyer of goods and services.  This trading tool is legally binding in almost all countries of the world, providing better transparency and creating trust in your business.
 Using an LC, you can do business with any company or business around the world while being certain that all goods agreed upon will be received and that all payments will be fulfilled.

For any company, this secured access to the global market means lower prices and better services in a wider market.  Additionally, it means that you can safely offer your goods and services to any buyer around the world, with little risk that the products you have provided will not be paid for.

What are the different types of Letters of Credit?
 There are different types of LCs depending on the kind of business or transaction that it is needed.  In most cases, these secondary features are used to increase security and make the operation easier, faster, and more transparent.
 While there is a definite time and place of each type of LC, business should be aware that certain additions and clauses stipulated might increase the bank’s fee, or add some features that can cause future problems for one of the parties involved.
 Irrevocable
An Irrevocable Letter of Credit allows the buyer to cancel or amend the LC, provided that other parties agree.  This can be used to trade additional goods that were not a part of the original LC inside the same shipment or to allow the exporter of products extra time to fulfil their obligation.
 Confirmed
A Confirmed Letter of Credit is used to further ensure the seller by adding more security.  This addition stipulates that if the issuing bank from the buyer doesn’t pay the requested amount of money, the seller’s bank guarantees payment.

This article can be added if there is reduced trust in the buyer, or if the money requested is crucial to stable financial liquidity of the seller.
 Most LCs will include this clause in the agreement, especially in international trade between partners that haven’t done business in the past.
 Transferable
A Transferable Letter of Credit is commonly used when there are intermediaries involved in the transaction, or when there are more than two parties included in the LC.  In this case, the LC can be transferred to other entities, provided that the original beneficiary agrees.
 This type is usually employed by the seller’s bank, especially when the seller is an SME, as a way to reduce the risk of the transaction to the bank, usually decreasing the price of the trade in the process.
 Letter of Credit at Sight
This article of the LC stipulates that all payments will be fulfilled as soon as there is documentation that the goods or services have been received by the buyer.  This payment can be made by the buyer, or by the buyer’s issuing bank, giving the buyer some additional time to fulfil the debt.

Contrary to this type of LC, there is the Standby Letter of Credit that doesn’t have this clause, and that needs to be activated in the case that the buyer can’t fulfil the payment.
 Deferred or Usance Letter of Credit
A deferred or
usance LC
is used to allow deferred payment from the buyer for a specified time period.  This slightly reduces the risk of unintentional non-payment and lowers the cost of an LC.  Additionally, a Deferred Letter of Credit is more enticing for the buyer, making it more likely for them to accept buying goods or services.
 Red Clause
A Red Clause Letter of Credit obligates the buyer’s issuing bank to provide partial payment to the seller prior to shipping products or providing the service.  It is usually used to secure a certain supplier and to expedite the shipping process, but it often makes the LC significantly more expensive.

 Are there alternatives to using a Letter of Credit?
 There are several situations where a business is either unable to get access to a letter of credit, perhaps due to a low credit score, or, because the supplier or customer does not want to use an LC to finance the transaction.  Given that open account trade cover 80% of cross-border trade, businesses with good commercial relationships often won’t use LCs.  Alternatives to LCs are often used to finance small purchases, perhaps those under $100k, given that they are significantly cheaper and faster to set up.
 Revolving Vendor Accounts
In cases where a business has a good trading history, as well as paying its vendors and suppliers in time, revolving vendor accounts can be used to extend payment terms.  Using these tools, a business can order supplies, materials, and services in advance on credit.  Once all the necessary materials are ordered, a business can forward them to end users or customers, paying the supplier before the credit is due.

This type of account can be problematic however, as the seller may refuse to ship goods and services to a business that hasn’t paid their previous charge.  Finally, some sellers will reject to enter this agreement, especially if abroad, as the entire risk of debt collection falls on the seller.
 Purchase Order Financing
In this case, a third party, either a commercial bank or another entity can finance the advances or outstanding payables on any goods and services paid, assuming the risk of the sale contract not being fulfilled.  This type of financing is usually made for a relatively short time period and it is not as uniform as a Letter of Credit.
 Due to the fact that all risk is on the third party, this type of credit is usually more expensive and not applicable to sales of common goods.  Read our PO finance guide

.
 Invoice Factoring
This alternative to LC assumes that a third party, usually a commercial bank, will advance the seller for up to 80% of the total charge, assuming the risk of the customer or buyer paying the invoice in total once the goods arrive.  Once the invoice is paid, the bank’s fee is withheld, and the rest of the funds are transferred to the seller’s account.
 This tool is very useful to companies that suffer from diminished liquidity, but as the bank is taking more risk than when using a Letter of Credit, it is significantly more expensive than an LC.  Trade Finance Global have put together a more extensive invoice factoring guide, which can be found

.
 What are the disadvantages of these products?
 The main disadvantage of using an LC compared to other methods is the relative cost of insurance, that may increase the overall cost of doing business.  Letters of Credit should be used primarily on large shipments that may influence the liquidity and cash flow of the company, as well as when doing business with international buyers and sellers.

Additionally, an LC creates an issue for sellers, as the payment will be based on the documentation, and not the actual goods or services provided.  Sellers need to be certain that the goods mentioned in the agreement are exactly as they are, with every minute detail included.
 Finally, the disadvantage for the buyer is that the payment is connected to the documentation and not the actual provision of goods and services.  Buyers need to ensure that all received products are exactly per specifications and have no flaws or damages before they create the necessary documentation that proves that they have received the goods.
 What is the difference between a red clause and green clause letters of credit?
 A red clause letter of credit is a variation of the traditional LC that contains a unique clause allowing the bank to make advance payments to the exporter before the exporter presents any shipping documents.
 Similar to a red clause LC, a green clause LC is a variation on the traditional LC that allows a nominating bank to make an advance payment to the exporter.  Experts often consider green clause LCs to be an extension of red clause LCs.
 The key differences between red and green clause letters of credit are:
1) Advance percentage:
– With a red clause LC, the percentage of the total letter value available for an advance is generally around 20 – 25%.
 – In contrast, with a green letter of credit, the percentage is far greater, often closer to 75 – 80% of the total value of the letter.
 2) Security:
– Importers have much more security if using a green clause LC because of the stringent documentation requirements. 
If importing goods, the buyer is technically providing the advance against the documentation of title.
 – Using a red clause LC, the buyer can take an advance before the producer has even made the goods.

 What are the key standards and legal frameworks governing letters of credit?
 Key Standards
The ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) establishes the global standards for the utilisation of letters of credit in international trade.  Additionally, the Swift network, particularly its Category 7—Documentary Credits standards, serves as the primary technical framework for handling LC, making Swift the central infrastructure for exchanging LCs and related messages.  Typically, MT700 message is sent by the issuing bank to the advising bank to indicate the terms and conditions of a documentary credit which has been originated by the sender (issuing bank).
 Legal Framework
LCs are subject to the ICC Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600).  The legal requirements for using a LC can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific terms and conditions of the LC.
 Sourced from ICC DSI
How do you use a Letter of Credit?

Letters of Credit are issued and formatted under the guidelines of the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits, or the
UCP600
, that is issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  Using one is fairly straightforward, both for businesses selling and those buying goods and services.
 One of the parties, usually the importer, will contact a bank to serve as an intermediary and to guarantee to the seller that the goods will be paid for according to the agreement.  All parties involved need to agree to the terms and sign the contract.  This lowers the risk of doing business significantly, as Letters of Credit are legally binding documents that are acknowledged by 175 countries worldwide.
 Check the documents carefully
Although the guidelines and the form of any LC are largely the same, the content is not.  It is crucial that both the buyer and the seller inspect the documents carefully and check for errors and mistakes that may end up in delays, further costs, or deferred payment. 
Even a minor oversight can be quite costly in this regard, and it is advisable to use several sets of eyes to check the documents.
 Letter of Credit terms include:
Advising bank
– accepts and then notifies the beneficiary of the LC
Confirming bank
– financial institution that agrees to honour and payment the LC to the beneficiary and receives payment from the advising bank
Irrevocable
– A non-amendable LC, unless agreed by all parties
Issuing bank / issuer
– the party that issues the LC
Presentation
– delivery of the LC documentation and any other required documents that are required by the beneficiary should payment be made / the LC honoured
Revocable
– a type of LC that can be withdrawn, amended or cancelled by the issuing party at any time
Standby
– the most common LC type whereby agreement to pay is made under certain conditions

 What is a Letter of Credit (LC)?
 Letters of credit (also know as documentary credits) are payment instruments that constitute a definite undertaking of the issuer (“the issuing bank”) on the instruction of the buyer (“applicant”) to pay a certain specified amount to a seller (“the beneficiary”) at sight or on a future determinable date (“the maturity date”) provided that documents stipulated in the letter of credit/documentary credit are presented in compliance with the stated terms and conditions.
 The issuing bank issues the documentary credit on behalf of its customer (“the applicant”) or on its own behalf.
 These undertakings are known as “documentary credits”, as they specify the documents that must be presented in order for the credit to be honoured.
 These are also known as “letters of credit” (LCs) as they were originally issued in a physical document form addressed to the beneficiary with the issuing bank’s undertaking to pay upon receipt of complying documents.
 There are several critical features of documentary credits/letters of credit:
Irrevocability
: documentary credits constitute an irrevocable undertaking of the issuer to pay, meaning that, once issued, the credit cannot be revoked or changed by the issuing bank. 
A credit can only be amended or cancelled with the consent of the issuing bank, the beneficiary, and the confirming bank (if any).
 Documentary nature
: documentary credits are documentary in nature and any payment undertakings contained in them are conditional upon receipt of documents as stated in the terms and conditions of the credit.
 Compliance
: documentary credits are settled only when the documents presented by or on behalf of the beneficiary comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.  Therefore, to obtain payment under a documentary credit, the beneficiary must present documents which comply with each credit’s terms & conditions.  If the documents contained do not comply (also known as discrepancies), an issuing bank may refuse to honour and is only obligated to pay if the non-complying documents are corrected and made compliant before the credit expires, or if the applicant waives the discrepancies and the issuing bank also agrees to waive any discrepancy(ies).

Payment mechanism
: documentary credits constitute a payment mechanism designed to facilitate the settlement of an underlying trade transaction whereby the applicant (the buyer) receives the goods or services, and the beneficiary (the seller) obtains payment via the credit which would then satisfy the applicant’s payment obligations against the underlying sales or other contract on which it may be based.
 Independence and autonomy
: documentary credits constitute an independent undertaking of the issuing bank and the confirming bank (if any) separate from the underlying sale or other contract on which it may be based.  The principle of autonomy is articulated within the ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 2007 Revision (“UCP 600”) and is upheld throughout the world.
 Purpose
The purpose of a documentary credit is to provide a mechanism or arrangement to facilitate the settlement of an international or domestic trade transaction by use of a bank undertaking.
 It should be noted that banks only deal with documents and not with goods, services or performance to which the documents may relate.

The terms and conditions of a documentary credit form the basis upon which the applicant must reimburse an issuing bank when a complying presentation is made.
 Documentary credits assure the beneficiary of payment as long as they present the requisite complying documents to the nominated bank, the confirming bank (if any), or the issuing bank.

Who should use a Letter of Credit?

Letters of Credit are useful to any business that trades in large volumes, both domestically, and cross-border.  They are important to ensure the cash flow of a company and lowers the risk of default due to non-payment from the end customer.
 Additionally, a LC can benefit companies that structure their business around e-Commerce or services.
 When deciding whether or not to request a LC, some considerations might include:
The costs associated versus the risk of non-payment, as well as which party will incur these costs
Legal requirements and expertise required
Documentation needed (for proof of delivery, sending the goods across e.g.  customs declaration and insurance documents)
The supplier / customers creditworthiness
Overseas Business
International traders or wholesale producers of goods are the primary users of LC.  These types of company need to be certain that they will not suffer losses from selling to overseas buyers that they are unfamiliar with.
 In the unfortunate case that the recipient of the goods is unwilling or unable to pay the seller, the LC is activated, and under the terms of the agreement, the bank will be obliged to cover the missing payment. 
After the intermediary completes the payment, the bank will deal with the buyer according to the domestic law of the country where the buyer is located.
 Online Business
Online,
e-commerce
and service businesses often use LC for overseas contracts.  For companies producing software, or other online services that demand the employment of significant resource, it is important to consider external finance to free up working capital.
 Small and Medium Enterprises
Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs) account for 99% of businesses.  Letters of Credit can help alleviate some of the cash flow constraints stemming from delayed and long payment terms from end customers.  Large international companies are often culprits for late payments to SMEs, which can often put small companies at financial strain, or even out of business.
 What are the benefits of using a Letter of Credit?
 Risk and trust are one of the major challenges when it comes to trade, be that domestic or international.  The specificity and legal weight of LC are a big advantage, given that they are accepted and acknowledged by 175 countries, reduce the risk of doing business overseas, and provide transparent collaboration between unknown parties.

Finally, Letters of Credit provide better clarity on the transaction, as all of the goods or services supplied would be defined in detail.  This provides additional comfort to the buyer as well as removing the possibility that the descriptions of the goods ordered are vastly different from what arrives.
 Key advantages:
Avoids potential disputes overseas
Some form of guarantee to a seller / supplier that they will get paid
Flexibility and variability across different types of LCs
Secure payment method endorsed by most major markets
Risk of non-payment is taken by the banks rather than the buyer
Often required by national border / exchange control agencies
How can a Letter of Credit help your business grow?
 Using Letters of Credit can significantly advantage your business, regardless if you are a seller or buyer of goods and services.  This trading tool is legally binding in almost all countries of the world, providing better transparency and creating trust in your business.
 Using an LC, you can do business with any company or business around the world while being certain that all goods agreed upon will be received and that all payments will be fulfilled.

For any company, this secured access to the global market means lower prices and better services in a wider market.  Additionally, it means that you can safely offer your goods and services to any buyer around the world, with little risk that the products you have provided will not be paid for.

What are the different types of Letters of Credit?
 There are different types of LCs depending on the kind of business or transaction that it is needed.  In most cases, these secondary features are used to increase security and make the operation easier, faster, and more transparent.
 While there is a definite time and place of each type of LC, business should be aware that certain additions and clauses stipulated might increase the bank’s fee, or add some features that can cause future problems for one of the parties involved.
 Irrevocable
An Irrevocable Letter of Credit allows the buyer to cancel or amend the LC, provided that other parties agree.  This can be used to trade additional goods that were not a part of the original LC inside the same shipment or to allow the exporter of products extra time to fulfil their obligation.
 Confirmed
A Confirmed Letter of Credit is used to further ensure the seller by adding more security.  This addition stipulates that if the issuing bank from the buyer doesn’t pay the requested amount of money, the seller’s bank guarantees payment.

This article can be added if there is reduced trust in the buyer, or if the money requested is crucial to stable financial liquidity of the seller.
 Most LCs will include this clause in the agreement, especially in international trade between partners that haven’t done business in the past.
 Transferable
A Transferable Letter of Credit is commonly used when there are intermediaries involved in the transaction, or when there are more than two parties included in the LC.  In this case, the LC can be transferred to other entities, provided that the original beneficiary agrees.
 This type is usually employed by the seller’s bank, especially when the seller is an SME, as a way to reduce the risk of the transaction to the bank, usually decreasing the price of the trade in the process.
 Letter of Credit at Sight
This article of the LC stipulates that all payments will be fulfilled as soon as there is documentation that the goods or services have been received by the buyer.  This payment can be made by the buyer, or by the buyer’s issuing bank, giving the buyer some additional time to fulfil the debt.

Contrary to this type of LC, there is the Standby Letter of Credit that doesn’t have this clause, and that needs to be activated in the case that the buyer can’t fulfil the payment.
 Deferred or Usance Letter of Credit
A deferred or
usance LC
is used to allow deferred payment from the buyer for a specified time period.  This slightly reduces the risk of unintentional non-payment and lowers the cost of an LC.  Additionally, a Deferred Letter of Credit is more enticing for the buyer, making it more likely for them to accept buying goods or services.
 Red Clause
A Red Clause Letter of Credit obligates the buyer’s issuing bank to provide partial payment to the seller prior to shipping products or providing the service.  It is usually used to secure a certain supplier and to expedite the shipping process, but it often makes the LC significantly more expensive.
 Find out more about the different types of LC in the next page of our LC guide,
here
.
 Are there alternatives to using a Letter of Credit?
 There are several situations where a business is either unable to get access to a letter of credit, perhaps due to a low credit score, or, because the supplier or customer does not want to use an LC to finance the transaction.  Given that open account trade cover 80% of cross-border trade, businesses with good commercial relationships often won’t use LCs.  Alternatives to LCs are often used to finance small purchases, perhaps those under $100k, given that they are significantly cheaper and faster to set up.
 Revolving Vendor Accounts
In cases where a business has a good trading history, as well as paying its vendors and suppliers in time, revolving vendor accounts can be used to extend payment terms.  Using these tools, a business can order supplies, materials, and services in advance on credit.  Once all the necessary materials are ordered, a business can forward them to end users or customers, paying the supplier before the credit is due.

This type of account can be problematic however, as the seller may refuse to ship goods and services to a business that hasn’t paid their previous charge.  Finally, some sellers will reject to enter this agreement, especially if abroad, as the entire risk of debt collection falls on the seller.
 Purchase Order Financing
In this case, a third party, either a commercial bank or another entity can finance the advances or outstanding payables on any goods and services paid, assuming the risk of the sale contract not being fulfilled.  This type of financing is usually made for a relatively short time period and it is not as uniform as a Letter of Credit.
 Due to the fact that all risk is on the third party, this type of credit is usually more expensive and not applicable to sales of common goods.  Read our PO finance guide
here
.
 Invoice Factoring
This alternative to LC assumes that a third party, usually a commercial bank, will advance the seller for up to 80% of the total charge, assuming the risk of the customer or buyer paying the invoice in total once the goods arrive.  Once the invoice is paid, the bank’s fee is withheld, and the rest of the funds are transferred to the seller’s account.
 This tool is very useful to companies that suffer from diminished liquidity, but as the bank is taking more risk than when using a Letter of Credit, it is significantly more expensive than an LC.  Trade Finance Global have put together a more extensive invoice factoring guide, which can be found
here
.
 What are the disadvantages of these products?
 The main disadvantage of using an LC compared to other methods is the relative cost of insurance, that may increase the overall cost of doing business.  Letters of Credit should be used primarily on large shipments that may influence the liquidity and cash flow of the company, as well as when doing business with international buyers and sellers.

Additionally, an LC creates an issue for sellers, as the payment will be based on the documentation, and not the actual goods or services provided.  Sellers need to be certain that the goods mentioned in the agreement are exactly as they are, with every minute detail included.
 Finally, the disadvantage for the buyer is that the payment is connected to the documentation and not the actual provision of goods and services.  Buyers need to ensure that all received products are exactly per specifications and have no flaws or damages before they create the necessary documentation that proves that they have received the goods.
 What is the difference between a red clause and green clause letters of credit?
 A red clause letter of credit is a variation of the traditional LC that contains a unique clause allowing the bank to make advance payments to the exporter before the exporter presents any shipping documents.
 Similar to a red clause LC, a green clause LC is a variation on the traditional LC that allows a nominating bank to make an advance payment to the exporter.  Experts often consider green clause LCs to be an extension of red clause LCs.
 The key differences between red and green clause letters of credit are:
1) Advance percentage:
– With a red clause LC, the percentage of the total letter value available for an advance is generally around 20 – 25%.
 – In contrast, with a green letter of credit, the percentage is far greater, often closer to 75 – 80% of the total value of the letter.
 2) Security:
– Importers have much more security if using a green clause LC because of the stringent documentation requirements. 
If importing goods, the buyer is technically providing the advance against the documentation of title.
 – Using a red clause LC, the buyer can take an advance before the producer has even made the goods.

 What are the key standards and legal frameworks governing letters of credit?
 Key Standards
The ICC Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) establishes the global standards for the utilisation of letters of credit in international trade.  Additionally, the Swift network, particularly its Category 7—Documentary Credits standards, serves as the primary technical framework for handling LC, making Swift the central infrastructure for exchanging LCs and related messages.  Typically, MT700 message is sent by the issuing bank to the advising bank to indicate the terms and conditions of a documentary credit which has been originated by the sender (issuing bank).
 Legal Framework
LCs are subject to the ICC Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600).  The legal requirements for using a LC can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specific terms and conditions of the LC.
 Sourced from ICC DSI
How do you use a Letter of Credit?

Letters of Credit are issued and formatted under the guidelines of the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits, or the
UCP600
, that is issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  Using one is fairly straightforward, both for businesses selling and those buying goods and services.
 One of the parties, usually the importer, will contact a bank to serve as an intermediary and to guarantee to the seller that the goods will be paid for according to the agreement.  All parties involved need to agree to the terms and sign the contract.  This lowers the risk of doing business significantly, as Letters of Credit are legally binding documents that are acknowledged by 175 countries worldwide.
 Check the documents carefully
Although the guidelines and the form of any LC are largely the same, the content is not.  It is crucial that both the buyer and the seller inspect the documents carefully and check for errors and mistakes that may end up in delays, further costs, or deferred payment. 
Even a minor oversight can be quite costly in this regard, and it is advisable to use several sets of eyes to check the documents.
 Letter of Credit terms include:
Advising bank
– accepts and then notifies the beneficiary of the LC
Confirming bank
– financial institution that agrees to honour and payment the LC to the beneficiary and receives payment from the advising bank
Irrevocable
– A non-amendable LC, unless agreed by all parties
Issuing bank / issuer
– the party that issues the LC
Presentation
– delivery of the LC documentation and any other required documents that are required by the beneficiary should payment be made / the LC honoured
Revocable
– a type of LC that can be withdrawn, amended or cancelled by the issuing party at any time
Standby
– the most common LC type whereby agreement to pay is made under certain conditions

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company

Risk Mitigation and Benefits
Risk Mitigation
International trade transactions often involve buyers and sellers residing in countries with different legal systems, currencies, market practices, customs, trade, and exchange control regulations.
 Buyers can face challenges in evaluating the credibility of foreign suppliers and have to bear the risks associated with the seller failing to fulfil its contractual obligations.  This can include non-delivery or delayed delivery of the goods or goods that do not meet the quality standards agreed upon in the contract.
 Given the challenge of remedying these issues in a foreign and unfamiliar legal system, buyers naturally prefer to commit to making payment only after receiving the goods to their satisfaction.
 Likewise, sellers must bear the risk of non-payment and, if that occurs, would need to take legal action against the buyer in the buyer’s country.  This means that sellers naturally prefer to receive payment before making a shipment.

This dynamic, where buyers only want to pay after delivery, but sellers want to receive payment before shipping, creates an imbalance in the system.  Documentary credits provide a mechanism to address and help resolve these conflicting interests.
 UCP 600 and International Standard Banking Practice (ISBP) publication 821 govern documentary credits and provide the rules and practice for the examination of documents.  As such, when traders deal under the terms of a documentary credit, there is a reduced likelihood of misunderstanding or misinterpretation, which helps to minimise the risk of unforeseen disputes.
 To avail upon the benefit of the documentary credit mechanism, it is vital for the beneficiary to clearly state the terms and conditions of the documentary credit, including which documents are needed and which party should issue them.  Likewise, the beneficiary must submit the documents stipulated in the documentary credit’s terms and conditions.
 Benefits
The benefits of documentary credits differ depending on which side of the transaction a party finds themselves on.

For the buyer in an international transaction (i.e., the applicant), the primary benefits are assurance that:
In most cases, they will only need to make payment after the shipment has been made.
 The seller will submit the documents required by the credit which should allow for customs clearance needs.
 The issuing bank will examine the submitted documents for compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit before payment is made.
 For the seller in an international transaction (i.e., the beneficiary), the primary benefits of a documentary credit are that:
The risk of payment under the sales contract shifts from the buyer to the issuing bank (which may have a credit rating which exceeds the applicant’s).  The credit is independent of the sales contract and in instances where a presentation complies with the credit, the issuing bank is obligated to pay.  In the event they do not pay, for whatever reason, the seller can still rely on the sales contract from its buyer.
 A documentary credit cannot be cancelled or amended without beneficiary agreement since a documentary credit is, by definition, irrevocable.

The issuing, confirming or nominated bank which agreed to act upon its nomination, if there is one, will make payment upon presentation to them of complying documents.
 There is the possibility of further recourse to a confirming bank.  (This is useful if the seller has concerns regarding the political, or legal landscape for the buyer’s country or the credit rating of the issuing bank).

Handling Document Discrepancies
When firms present documents under a documentary credit, banks examine them against the terms and conditions of the documentary credit based on UCP 600 (provided the documentary credit is subject to it), international standard banking practice, and data between the documents themselves.
 If the documents do not comply, they are discrepant.
 In documentary credit operations, advising document discrepancies is the most contentious issue a bank will face with its clients or another bank.  It is, therefore, imperative that the respective discrepancies are of such detail that the presenter is in no doubt about the reason for the refusal.  A beneficiary should always seek clarification if a bank is unclear in its rejection of presented documents.
 Whether or not a bank refuses documents is based on the content of the documents themselves and their conformity to the documentary credit and UCP. 
Ultimately, any discrepancy should stand one test: “Would you feel comfortable justifying that discrepancy before a judge in a court of law?” Remember, at the end of the day, a court will make the final judgement if the parties cannot amicably resolve a dispute.
 Clarity is the key.  A bank that provides a refusal notice stating “Invoice not as per LC” tells the beneficiary or the applicant nothing.  Is the goods description wrong?  Is a required certification missing?  Is there some other specific issue?  A refusal notice must be of sufficient detail and clarity for the presenter of the documents to understand it without having a copy of the actual documentary credit in front of them.
 Pre-requisites
A covering schedule accompanying the documents should include the presenter’s reference number and contact details in case of any problems.  It should also include information on how and where to make payment, reference to payment of charges, and details of where and how to send the settlement advice.
 UCP 600allows banks a maximum of five banking days following the presentation day to determine if a presentation is complying.  It is important to note that, in most circumstances, documents will be examined by the nominated or confirming bank and the issuing bank.  Each bank has a maximum of five banking days to examine the documents.
 The UCP 600 does not expect banks to need the full five banking days to examine documents, although certain circumstances may exist when this is the case. 
Competition between banks for business typically ensures that most presentations are reviewed within 48 hours, if not on the day of receipt.
 Obligations of a Bank
A nominated bank that has agreed to act on its nomination, a confirming bank, or an issuing bank must determine whether the documents are compliant.  Each bank must decide whether or not to issue a refusal notice based on its examination of the documents.  However, it does not always follow that a bank that identifies a discrepancy will refuse the documents.
 The bank may not consider a discrepancy to warrant a refusal.  One example of a minor difference would be if the documentary credit required six document copies, but a presenter only provided five.  In this case, the bank may opt to make the additional copy itself rather than refuse the documents.
 In respect of an issuing bank, it must decide whether or not to approach the applicant for a waiver of discrepancies.  Approaching the applicant for a waiver can give rise to five different results:
The applicant agrees to waive, and the issuing bank accepts the waiver. 
Issuing bank honours.
 The applicant agrees to waive, but the issuing bank does not agree to accept the waiver.  The issuing bank issues a refusal notice indicating it is returning the documents or seeking further instructions for their disposal or handling.
 The applicant does not agree to waive, and the issuing bank issues a refusal notice indicating it is returning the documents or seeking further instructions for their disposal or handling.
 The applicant has not provided its waiver of discrepancies within the time allowed by the UCP 600 (which can be no later than the close of the 5th banking day following the day of presentation unless the credit says otherwise), so the issuing bank refuses the documents.
 The issuing bank withdraws the request for a waiver due to an incorrect refusal.  (This would happen if the presenter provides a valid argument for withdrawing the discrepancy—for example, particular wording of the documentary credit or an amendment appearing within a document).

Issues for a Beneficiary to Consider
Through this process, there are several issues for the beneficiary to consider.  For example, can it be sure that the documents are discrepant?  Has the bank missed a condition in the documentary credit?  Has data been inserted on a document but not seen?
 Beneficiaries must be aware of the content of the UCP 600, particularly articles 3, 14, and 17-32, together with the practices outlined in the ISBP.  The ISBP is a publication which, by title, refers to the examination of documents by banks and how they should apply the articles of UCP 600 to given documents.  Using reverse logic, if a beneficiary understands how a bank will examine its documents, it should be able to prepare them to that standard and avoid many problems.
 Options in the Event of Discrepancies
If there are discrepancies, three options exist:
Correct the discrepancies by either amending the documents or by replacement,
Request that the nominated bank or confirming bank sends a message to the issuing bank seeking approval to honour or negotiate despite the discrepancies that they have found whilst holding the documents with them or
Request that the nominated or confirming bank forward the documents to the issuing bank for settlement.
 In respect of point 3, the use of terms such as “on a collection basis” and “in trust”, are acceptable between the beneficiary and the nominated bank, BUT SHOULD NOT be used in any communications to the issuing bank, as they imply that the rules for documentary collections are to be applied rather than the rules for documentary credits.

Remember that the respective parties could avoid or resolve many discrepancies through careful attention to detail in the documentary credit or amendment application.  Handled correctly, preparing and examining documents is valuable to the beneficiary, the applicant, and the industry.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

SWIFT Messaging Types
Structured data and standard formats for exchanging information around bank guarantees and letters of credit are key for the digitisation of trade finance. 
Interbank and bank-to-corporate messaging remains a challenge, and whilst the industry welcomes moves towards structured data and SWIFT’s new messaging types, there are still challenges.  TFG heard from Olli Jääsaari, Standardised Trust expert and
Nordea
’s Trade Finance & WCM Product Manager.

 SWIFT Messaging Types for Guarantees and Its Uses
DP:
What are the current uses for messaging types when it comes to Bank Guarantees?  What is SWIFT MT 760, 767 and 798?
 OJ:
Anyone who has worked with bank guarantees transmitted between banks will be well aware of the current
MT 760
guarantee issuance and MT 767 guarantee amendment formats: there are a couple of fields for applicable rules and a date, but the main content of the message is in a single, free format narrative field.  Regardless of who pays the fees, what the guarantee text is or which rules and which law is applied, it’s all in field 77C: Details of Guarantee.
 Using a free format field is of course very convenient.  Any scenario ranging from a simple request to advise an issued guarantee, requesting advise and confirmation of a standby, right up to a chain of multiple counter guarantees leading to local issuance of an undertaking, is easily sent using MT 760 or MT 767.
 The downside of this free format flexibility is that automation is difficult.  Picking out the parties in the transaction, the guaranteed commitment or even the guarantee amount or expiry date requires that the information in the narrative is parsed.

The bank-to-corporate channel used, utilising
MT 798
, however, manages to solve this in the message flow between corporate and bank by using an index message with a structured format.  However, this is always accompanied by the unstructured narrative.
 Implementation of the New SWIFT Messaging Standards
DP:
What are the proposed changes for SWIFT messaging standards (MT 760 and MT 767) and when is this changing?
 OJ:
The upcoming SWIFT message standards, which are set to go live in November 2021, attempt to solve the current issues by using structured fields in the bank-to-bank messages MT 760 and MT 767.  Such fields would include the guarantee amount, expiry date and parties, among other things.
 Going forward, the MT 760 and MT 767 can only be used for demand guarantees and standbys.  All sureties, accessory guarantees and other dependent undertakings will need to be sent in MT 759 ancillary trade messages, which continue the use of a single large narrative field.  My opinion is that this split causes more harm than good, especially when combined with the suggested MT 798 standards – but this will be elaborated on later.

Additionally, some messages receive minor tweaks which don’t have a big impact on usage, and some new message types are introduced for demand for payment and amendment responses.
 Benefits of New MT 760 and MT 767 Formats
DP:
Can structured messages bring automation benefits to trade?
 OJ:
The development of the new MT 760 and MT 767 formats is appreciated, as they enable easier process automation in many areas, such as compliance screening, or sorting incoming messages to different handling depending on whether they’re standbys to be advised without any risk, or requests to issue a local undertaking against a counter guarantee.
 However, building separate handling for dependent undertakings in MT 759 is an additional cost.  If only the code DEPU – for dependent undertakings – was allowed in the MT 760 and 767 formats, the same handling could be utilised!
 DP:
What do these changes mean for corporates, and which guarantee text is the corporate requesting?
 OJ:
As mentioned before, the current message standards for MT 798 messages between corporates and banks already contain a large part of this data in structured format, detailing the data which is also included in the free-text narrative field of today’s guarantee messages.
 This means that the change will not be that big for corporate-to-bank communication, as long as we consider only demand guarantees and standbys.  Dependent undertakings, unfortunately, are a whole other story.
 First of all, the guarantee request message, and response thereto, must contain a message structured like an MT 760, despite the instrument being issued as an MT 759.  This means that the corporate must think about how their bank will treat the different fields in the request, and the bank must also carefully consider what the customer wants, in order ensure correct content is populated into the MT 759 narrative field.

Then, once the MT 759 is sent, the bank must inform the customer of the issued guarantee.  Usually one would do this by sending a copy of the outgoing message, but for some reason the message standard makes it mandatory to translate this 759 message into the 760 format.  And note that this is the very same format, which explicitly disallows dependent undertakings in bank-to-bank communication!
 If only the code DEPU – for dependent undertakings – was allowed in the bank-to-bank MT 760 and 767 formats, the mismatch would be avoided!
 New SWIFT Messaging Formats – Issues for Advising Banks
DP:
In your opinion, what are the main issues for advising banks?
 OJ:
The very same issue is encountered when a bank is requested to advise a surety to a corporate without taking any risk.  Ideally, the advising bank would forward the incoming guarantee text to the corporate as is, without any changes.
 The incoming message will be an MT 759, so the bank has two options:
Forward the MT 759 to the corporate as a free format message. 
The bank is happy, but the corporate is not as they cannot automate their process.
 Translate the MT 759 into the structured MT 760 format (which still disallows sureties in bank-to-bank communication).  The corporate is happy, but the forwarded guarantee message contains a lot of information that the bank has had to parse from the free-format narrative field; which begs the question about liability in case of a mismatch in data between fields, or between the advise message and the incoming 759.
 If only the code DEPU – for dependent undertakings – was allowed in the MT 760 and 767 formats in bank-to-bank communication, there would be no issue to discuss here!
 SWIFT’s new messaging types and structured formats – a silver lining for digital trade?
 The structured message formats bring clear benefits for banks and enable wider automation of processes.  The split between dependent undertakings in free-format MT 759 and demand guarantees in structured MT 760 should, however, be removed.
 Allowing sureties and accessory guarantees to be sent by MT 760 would follow current market practice, reduce work in building parallel handling in banks, and remove the mismatch between the bank-to-bank and bank-to-corporate SWIFT messages.
 As the Category 7 message changes have been postponed to November 2021, there would still be time to see if there is support for doing a change to the formats.  In any case, the discussions in Standardised Trust have shown the value of collaborating not only between banks, but keeping corporates involved as well, together with software vendors for banks and corporates alike.

Contents
Parties Involved
Several distinct entities can be parties to a documentary credit.  Some must be present, while others are optional and only added to meet certain goals or requirements for the specific interaction.  This chapter highlights the possible parties in documentary credits.
 The Applicant
The applicant is usually the buyer of the goods who requests (or applies to)
the
issuing bank
to issue a documentary credit on its behalf.
 In its application, the applicant details the documents required under the documentary credit along with applicable terms and conditions.  Even though the applicant initiates the request, it is not a party to the documentary credit since a credit is a bank undertaking.
 The Issuing Bank
The issuing bank issues the documentary credit as per
the applicant’s
request.
 The issuing bank irrevocably undertakes to pay
the beneficiary
upon receipt of the necessary documents as determined by the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.

The Beneficiary
The beneficiary is the party in whose favour the documentary credit is issued.  It is generally the seller in an international trade transaction.
 The Confirming Bank
A confirming bank can provide an irrevocable undertaking – in addition to that of
the issuing bank
– to honour the documentary credit.
 This means that it agrees to pay at sight, or to incur a deferred payment undertaking, or to accept a bill of exchange (depending on the availability of the credit) on receipt of compliant documents as stipulated in the documentary credit’s terms and conditions.
 The Advising Bank
An advising bank receives the documentary credit from
the issuing bank
and advises
the beneficiary
on establishing its authenticity.
 By advising the documentary credit, the advising bank verifies that the documentary credit is authentic and provides assurance that the advice accurately reflects the terms and conditions of the documentary credit as received.  Unless the advising bank has confirmed the documentary credit, it assumes no further liability or responsibility.

The Nominated Bank
The issuing bank
can authorise another bank, called the nominated bank, to pay a presenter at sight, to accept a bill of exchange, or to incur a deferred payment undertaking to pay at maturity.
 Nomination by
the issuing bank
only imposes obligations on the nominated bank if it has confirmed the documentary credit or expressly agreed and communicated to
the beneficiary
that it will act on its nomination.
 The Reimbursing Bank
The reimbursing bank is another party – usually
the issuing bank’s
correspondent bank, with which
the issuing bank
maintains an account in the currency of the documentary credit.
 The documentary credit will stipulate the name of the reimbursing bank on which
the nominated bank
or
the confirming bank
(then known as “claiming bank”) should make a reimbursement claim.
 The issuing bank
authorises the reimbursing bank to honour a reimbursement claim
from the claiming bank
.  The reimbursement authorisation is often subject to the ICC Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements under Documentary Credits (URR 725). 
If not so indicated in the credit, reimbursement is subject to UCP 600 article 13 (Bank-to-Bank Reimbursement Arrangements).
 The Transferring Bank
In some cases,
the beneficiary
is an intermediary trader that sources the goods from another supplier and may request its buyer to arrange a transferable documentary credit.
 The
issuing bank
would then nominate a transferring bank to transfer the documentary credit.
 The beneficiary
(“first beneficiary”) will request the transferring bank to transfer the documentary credit in whole or in part to its own supplier (i.e., “second beneficiary”).
 For a transfer to occur, the documentary credit must explicitly state that it is transferable.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Financial Crime
By making available to their clients an array of trade finance products designed to facilitate international trade, banks have become accustomed to the need for practical tools and processes that manage and mitigate operational and documentary risk.  Fraud and, to varying degrees, sanction regulations have also required close monitoring with the inherent creation of specific practices, processes, and technological aids.
 Recently, financial crime has taken centre stage to the extent of an increased and collaborative focus on combating the issue.  It can significantly negatively impact individuals, companies, and the economy of countries.  Fraud is, and always will be, a potential risk in trade finance transactions.  However, while it is crucial to identify fraudulent transactions, they impact only a tiny percentage of global trade finance volumes.
 The ICC Financial Crime Risk and Policy Group describes financial crime as laundering money, financing terrorism and providing weapons for prohibited uses, breaking sanctions, financial fraud, financial crimes such as tax evasion, and other predicative offences related to trade products and other financial services.

Many international bodies have been established to combat such crime, with part of their focus on providing tools to help prevent and identify suspect transactions.  On an organisational level, there are several things that firms can do to help mitigate their exposure to financial crime and the resulting implications.
 All companies should maintain internal guidelines advising staff on the compliance requirements for handling trade finance transactions.  A key element should be identifying and handling transactions covering dual-use goods, which are goods that can be used for both civil and military purposes.
 Operations departments are not generally required to investigate commercial transactions that fall outside their scope of business or the type of transaction being handled.  However, they should be aware of the business of their counterparties and usual trading patterns.
 An organisation can occasionally find itself in a situation with potential legal implications and costs and the risk of irreparable damage to its reputation.

Reputational risk can often have far more significant consequences than the imposition of any financial penalty.
 Fraud
Fraudulent trade transactions have occurred since trading began thousands of years ago.  Buyers and sellers must know the potential for fraud and have safeguards built into their processes and procedures.  There is a saying that all stakeholders should consider: “If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.”
Lord Diplock (1907-1985), an English judge, referred to fraud in a documentary credit transaction as: “Documents that contain, expressly or by implication, material representations of fact that to [the issuer’s] knowledge are untrue.”
As with financial crime, companies must adopt processes, procedures and guidelines for identifying, escalating, and reporting fraudulent transactions to minimise potential financial loss.  Fortunately, fraud only impacts a tiny fraction of trade finance transactions due to the safeguards and risk mitigants inherent in ICC rules, provided they are used and complied with.

Here are some examples of common fraud-related scenarios:
A buyer believes that the seller has committed fraud and seeks to prevent a bank from effecting payment by obtaining a court injunction.
 Fraud based on either non-existent or poor-quality goods or falsifying one or more documents within a presentation under a documentary credit, standby credit, or guarantee.
 A bank refuses to pay the beneficiary based on alleged or proven fraud.
 A bank has effected payment, and a refund of the payment is required due to fraud.
 Fraudulently issued bank undertakings such as documentary credits, standby credits, and guarantees.
 Sanctions
A sanction is a measure adopted against a country, regime, or individual that officials believe is violating international law.  Sanctions are also political trade restrictions to maintain or restore international peace and security.
 Sanctions concerning trade finance are financial or trade controls that can be (and are) imposed for political or economic reasons by the United Nations, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in the USA, the European Union (EU) Council, and individual countries.
 The main objective of a sanction varies according to the applicable circumstances.  For example, an arms embargo and a ban on the export of certain items or raw materials could be aimed at supporting a peace process and restricting the financing of weapons by combatants.  Sanctions are also commonly aimed at preventing weapons from falling into the wrong hands.
 Several other examples of objectives that sanctions may seek to achieve are:
A change in the conduct of a particular country, regime, company, or individual.

Placing pressure on a country, regime, company, or individual to comply with set objectives.
 As a punitive measure when peace and security are threatened.
 Deterring, preventing, and suppressing terrorist financing and terrorist acts.
 Failure to comply with sanction regulations can be extremely costly, not only in terms of a monetary fine but also damage the reputation of the concerned parties.
 ICC Banking Commission
The ICC Banking Commission issued a guidance paper on using sanctions clauses in documentary credits in 2010, updated in 2014.  The paper deals with the use of clauses concerning trade, economic or financial sanctions, or embargoes in trade finance instruments (documentary and standby letters of credit, demand guarantees, and counter-guarantees) that are subject to the rules drafted by the ICC Banking Commission.
 The issue of sanctions applying to documentary credit transactions has surfaced several times.  As stated in the paper, sanction clauses have become problematic because they lead to uncertainty about their application and could defeat the independent nature of such instruments. 
The purpose of the ICC’s guidance paper was to highlight this issue and recommend best practices in that respect.
 Owing to a resurgence in using sanctions clauses in documentary credits, the ICC addressed this issue again and released an addendum to the guidance paper in May 2020.
 The key messages in this addendum are that:
Sanctions clauses should not be used routinely.
 Any clause should be drafted in clear terms according to the sample clause.
 The ICC re-states the recommendation that sanctions clauses should not be used under normal circumstances.  However, if one is to be used, then such a clause should be drafted in clear terms, restrictively, to limit the reference only to mandatory law applicable to the bank, according to the following sample clause:
“[notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the applicable ICC Rules or in this undertaking,]
we disclaim liability for delay, non-return of documents, non-payment, or other action or inaction compelled by restrictive measures, counter-measures or sanctions laws or regulations mandatorily applicable to us or to [our correspondent banks in] the relevant transaction.”

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

What is UCP?
 The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (“UCP”) is the rule governing the Documentary credits.  It was established by the international chamber of commerce (ICC) to mitigate the doubts caused by individual countries promoting their own national rules on documentary credit practice.  The objective, since attained, was to create a set of contractual rules that would establish uniformity in that practice, obtain global understanding, a common interpretation and application of documentary credit, so that practitioners would not have to cope with plenty of conflicting national regulations.  UCP is the most successful set of private rules for trade ever developed.
 UCP 500 versus UCP 600 – A brief history
The first version of the rules published by ICC in 1933 known as (UCP 82), it has been revised six times to keep pace with market needs and practices, in 1951 (UCP 151), 1962 (UCP 222), 1974 (UCP 290), 1983 (UCP 400), 1993 (UCP 500) and the latest version in 2007 known as (UCP 600).  First published in December 2006 and implemented on 1 July 2007.
 The origin of UCP 600 and its purpose
UCP 600 is the fruit of more than three years of work by the International Chamber of Commerce’s (ICC) Commission on Banking Technique and Practice.  One of the most important objectives of the UCP 600 is providing easier language and addressing the progress in various industries to unify the interpretation and application of documentary credits.
 The main issues that considered in shaping UCP 600
Addressing developments in banking, transport and insurance industries.
 Easier language and style to remove wordings that could lead to inconsistent application and interpretation.

Reviewing ICC Opinions, DOCDEX Decisions.

Considering the incorporation of or relationship with, ISBP 645, URR 525, ISP 98 and eUCP.
 Key Sections and Articles for the UCP 600
it comprises of 39 articles to cover the following:
Scope and application of the rules (article 1)
Definitions and interpretations (articles 2 and 3)
Obligations and liabilities (from article 4 to 13)
Examination and dealing with documents (from article 14 to 17)
Documents including commercial invoice, transport documents and insurance document (from article 18 to 28)
Miscellaneous Provisions (from article 19 to 33)
Disclaimers (from article 34 to 37)
Transfer and assignments (articles 38 and 39)
UCP 600 commentary
The publication provides the text of each article, the changes from UCP 500, the commentary explaining and analysing each article and sub-article of UCP 600 and cross-reference to other articles.
 The commentary reflects the view of the drafting group, users of the commentary should also be aware that the decision to accept or reject documents depends on the terms and conditions of the credit, the applicable provisions of UCP 600 not the commentary and international standard banking practice.

The introduction to the commentary on UCP 600 states:
‘the writing of the Commentary proved to be more difficult than drafting the rules themselves.’
With around 5000 comments received by the Drafting Group during the revision process, it was impossible for them to provide feedback on every issue that did or did not make it into the text of UCP 600.
 These issues included, amongst others, the following items:
Should the words “on its face” remain within the UCP?
 What was the value of the concept of “reasonable time” when there was no common standard for determining reasonableness globally?
 Should the UCP now reflect the growing practice of documentary credits being issued by non-banks, by substituting “issuer”, “confirmer”, etc., for the terms “issuing bank”, “confirming bank”, etc., that had been used in past UCPs?
 Was a majority of the Banking Commission in favour of including a rule covering the ability of a nominated bank to prepay or purchase a draft it accepted or a deferred payment it incurred?
 Was there a need for an equivalent of UCP 500 article 30 when the UCP transport document articles do not mention who is actually to “issue” the respective transport document?
 All of the points were debated at some length by national committees tasked with providing input, so that the Drafting Group could gauge where their representatives on the Banking Commission wished an article to be positioned.
 The objective of the commentary to enlighten practitioners about the processes behind the changes in each
article
and to explain why a change was introduced, why no change was made, why some issues may appear new but are not, i.e., a clarification rather than a change, and to suggest the way the wording in UCP 600 should be understood and applied.
 After UCP 600
After UCP 600
URR 725
As a result of the huge growth in the volume of inter-bank currency reimbursements remained largely subject to locally accepted practice in the major financial centres, with the one exception of the U.S.A, where banks had formulated their own operating rules, moreover, the practices around bank-to-bank reimbursements under documentary credits developed into more complicated procedures followed by banks not a party to the documentary credits providing the beneficiary with reimbursement promptly. 
To meet the need for international standards and to assist trade facilitation, the ICC banking commission authorized a working party to draft the Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements (URR 525) in 1993 and implemented on 1 July 1996.
 The update to URR 525 was necessary to bring the URR rules into conformity with the UCP 600, in April 2008 URR 725 was approved by the ICC national committees and implemented in October 2008. 
URR 725 should not be seen as a revision of URR 525. 
It is an updating process that has followed the same manner as the eUCP, i.e. 
to change the style to match that of UCP 600.

Banks that are requested or authorized to add their confirmation often require from an issuing bank before adding their confirmation to specify a reimbursing bank instead of reimbursed directly by an issuing bank.  UCP 600 article 13, covers basic principles for bank-to-bank reimbursements.  URR 725 covers these principles in more details and clarification, such as general provisions and definitions, liabilities and responsibilities, form and notification of authorizations, amendments and claims and miscellaneous provisions.
 The contents of URR 725
It comprises of 17 articles as the following:
Application of URR
Definitions
Reimbursement Authorizations Versus Credits
Honour of a Reimbursement Claim
Responsibility of the Issuing Bank
Issuance and Receipt of a Reimbursement Authorization or Reimbursement Amendment
Expiry of a Reimbursement Authorization
Amendment or Cancellation of a Reimbursement Authorization
Reimbursement Undertaking
Standards for a Reimbursement Claim
Processing a Reimbursement Claim
Duplication of a Reimbursement Authorization
Foreign Laws and Usages
Disclaimer on the Transmission of Messages
Force Majeure
Charges
Interest Claims/Loss of Value
What is ISBP 745?
 With the approval of UCP 600 in October 2006, it has become necessary to provide an updated version of the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP 645). 
The first version was Issued in 2003, it was felt appropriate, paragraphs that appeared in Publication 645 and that have been covered in effectively the same text in UCP 600 have been removed from the updated version of ISBP, publication 681 is the first revision of ISBP 645.  The introduction to UCP 600, states:
‘During the revision process, notice was taken of the considerable work that had been completed in creating the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP), ICC Publication 645’.
 A fully revised version of ISBP 681 was undertaken, in July 2013 ISBP 745 was published.  It filled a gap between the general rules of the UCP 600 and the daily job of the documentary credit practitioners and provides coverage of documents which are not specifically mentioned in UCP 600, as well as, it serves as a valuable tool for parties to correctly apply the principles of UCP 600 and accurately interpret and clarify conditions appearing within documentary credits, it covers a range of practices outlined by ICC Opinions issued since 2007, decisions of the ICC Banking Commission, and has been extended to cover documents including non-negotiable sea waybill, beneficiary certificate,  packing list, weight list, beneficiary certificates, analysis, inspection, health, phytosanitary, quantity and quality certificates.

It should be noted ISBP 745 doesn’t modify or exclude UCP 600 articles and both should be read in their entirety and not in isolation.  To emphasize this point, paragraph i. of Preliminary Considerations reads “This publication is to be read in conjunction with UCP 600 and not in isolation.”
Thierry Senechal, ICC Senior Policy Manager and Banking Commission Executive Secretary said:
“This guide has developed into an invaluable aid to banks, corporates, logistics specialists and insurance companies alike, on a global basis, when creating documents for presentation, or for the examination of documents presented under, a documentary credit.”
Gary Collyer, Chair of the Drafting Group for the revision of ISBP, said:
“Rejection rates have decreased since the original launch of the ISBP guide in 2002 and it is acknowledged that a major contributing factor to this is the application of the practices detailed in ISBP.”
Key Sections of ISBP 745
Each section begins with an alphabetical letter as the following:

ICC guidelines and guidance papers
The ICC recommendation and guidance papers do not amend the UCP rules or International Standard Banking Practice (ISBP), the papers act as a response from the ICC when various banks are applying unilateral and incorrect interpretations to certain articles and clarifying the proper interpretation and application when it determines that there is a need to do so, furthermore, to share practical views and guidance from experts in the management of trade finance transactions when exceptional events and issues arise for example this exceptional period because of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”).

Some of the ICC guidelines and guidance papers
The requirements for an on-board notation
The use of sanction clauses in trade finance-related instruments subject to ICC rules
Notes on the principle of strict compliance
Decision of the ICC in respect of a revision of UCP 600
The use of drafts (bills of exchange) under documentary credits
Notes for Documentary Credit Formats
The impact of COVID-19 on trade finance transactions issued subject to ICC rules
Addendum to guidance paper on the use of sanctions clauses 2014
The correct interpretation of the first paragraph of UCP 600 article 35
UCP 600 revision
Which is the latest version of UCP?
 UCP rules revised six times since the first publication in 1933, the period between each revision range from 9 to 14 years, on 15
th
June 2017 ICC Executive Committee released a document NO.470/1272 to announce their decision after the voting that held with National Committee Forum in Rome on 8
th
November 2016 and on 23
rd
November 2016 in Paris in respect of a revision of UCP 600, the results were that the majority of National Committees preferred not to proceed with a revision, despite there were a few counter-views and comments were given supporting a UCP revision.

Summary of the ICC decision in respect of a revision of UCP 600
It is not considered, at this stage, to be appropriate to revise UCP 600 as the most of the problems lay not with the rules themselves, but with the application, i.e.  practice of the rules (“international standard banking practice”).
 50% of the problems apply to the presented documents: it is a justifiable assumption that a greater understanding of ISBP 745 would help alleviate these problems and greatly reduce this percentage, the remaining 50%, it is difficult to see how a revision of UCP would make much of a material difference as many of these causes are outside the scope of correction by the beneficiary.
 The majority of problems are caused by:
poor drafting of the credit
Lack of understanding of documentary credit workflows and the principles of UCP 600
Lack of attention to detail and management of the production,
shipment
and document collation processes
Excessive and unnecessary data being added to documents
Restricted access to ISBP 745
Only seven items were identified for possible inclusion in a revision of UCP and most of these were already an integral part of ISBP 745.  No new problems were raised which would prove that existing rules are wrong or that there is a gap.
 The ICC Executive Committee Decision is greater understanding of practices should be the way forward, rather than a revision of the rules and this will be achieved by the implementation of a three-prong facilitation approach:
Overcoming the above problems
The following recommendations should be considered which could potentially reduce discrepancy ratios under documentary credits, as the rates of non-compliance are quite high, specifically on the first presentation.

As stated in ISBP 745 Preliminary Considerations (iv), ‘many of the problems that arise at the document examination stage could be avoided or resolved by the respective parties through careful attention to detail in the credit or amendment application and issuance of the credit or any amendment thereto’.
 An issuing bank should ensure that any credit or amendment it issues is not ambiguous or its wording subject to more than one interpretation and conflicting in its terms and conditions as most of the difficulties and complications that arise from poorly or badly drafted credits.
 Avoid inserting excessive details and including terms which only belong to an underlying agreement/contract that cause unintended consequences and payment delays.
 The applicant and beneficiary should carefully consider the documents required for presentation, by whom they are to be issued, their data content and the time frame in which they are to be presented.
 Documentary credits must not include conditions for which fulfilment cannot be ascertained from the face of a document.

Avoiding as much as possible to exclude or modify specific articles or sub-articles of UCP 600 unless that is necessary.
 Only necessary documents should be required by the credit and ensure the document descriptions are as simple as possible at the same time to meet any contractual requirements.
 Avoid adding generic requirements that are to apply to all presented documents.
 UCP 700 wish list
UCP 700 wish list
As mentioned above the ICC executive committee stated they won’t revise UCP 600 anytime soon, on the other hand, it also states there are issues identified for possible inclusion in a revision of UCP.  Several issues highlighted by trade finance experts for example:
Kim Sindberg in his blog ‘
UCP 700 – on the table?
 ’ He outlined the framework and the issues that needed to be addressed and indicated what should/could be changed under UCP 600 articles and why.
 David Meynell and Gary Collyer in their blogs ‘
UCP 700
’ &
‘UCP gaps’
They addressed a number of issues that seem rational for a new version of UCP 600.

A few of these issues outlined below:
The removal of the reference to standby letter of credit.
 The removal of the reference to ‘draft’.
 The removal of ‘negotiation’ as a form of availability.
 Should a sanctions article be added, or perhaps be included as a sub-article of article 36 ‘Force Majeure’?
 Transport, UCP should provide a correct reflection of market conditions, including transport and logistics.
 Inoperative credits, a clarification as to how and when the credit becomes operative.
 Some paragraphs from ISBP 745 that are more appropriate to be a rule rather than a practice.
 Suggestions for specific articles to be removed, reworked, reshaped or merged with ISBP.
 eUCP
The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP) Supplement for Electronic Presentations (“eUCP”) first published in 2002 as version 1.0 supplemented UCP 500, later updated as version 1.1 in 2007 to accompany the publication of UCP 600 and to bring it in line with the changes in terminology in UCP 600 and recently as version 2.0 in 2019 in order to accommodate current practice, technological developments and the continuing evolution toward electronic presentation.  The rules were intentionally developed with version numbers in order to be updated regularly when required according to future technological developments that emerge in trade finance and without impacting upon other existing ICC rules.
 Olivier Paul, ICC Director for Finance Development said:
“The digitalisation of trade is becoming more and more a reality. 
By releasing the new eRules, ICC is taking another step in the right direction to ensure that our rules are adapted to new realities,”
David Meynell, Co-Chair of the Working Group and Owner, TradeLC Advisory said:
“Extending the mitigation of risk from a paper environment to the electronic milieu safeguards the applicability of ICC rules whilst guaranteeing relevance in a constantly evolving digital trade world.”
By acknowledging the importance of the eRules, the ICC has made the full text of the
eUCP
available online for the use of trade finance practitioners everywhere.  ICC has also published an
article-by-article analysis
of eUCP V2.0 and eURC V1.0 to guide banks on the new rules.
 It is worth mentioning that, the eUCP doesn’t  address or define the method that is necessary to facilitate electronic presentation, these are left to the parties to agree on the platform or the system to be used.
 The contents of eUCP V2.0
It comprises of 14 articles, in order to avoid confusion between the articles of UCP and the eUCP the articles are numbered with an ‘e’ preceding each article number as the following:
e1 Scope of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) Supplement for Electronic Presentations (“eUCP”)
e2 Relationship of the eUCP to the UCP
e3 Definitions
e4 Electronic Records and Paper Documents V. Goods, Services or Performance (new article)
e5 Format
e6 Presentation
e7 Examination
e8 Notice of Refusal
e9 Originals and Copies
e10 Date of Issuance
e11 Transport
e12 Data Corruption of an Electronic Record
e13 Additional Disclaimer of Liability for Presentation of Electronic Records under eUCP
e14 Force Majeure (new article)
The relation between eUCP V2.0 & UCP 600 articles
The eUCP V2.0 is a supplement to UCP 600 and to be used in conjunction with UCP 600.

It shall apply where the credit indicates that is subject to eUCP V2.0.
 Credits issued subject to eUCP V2.0 are automatically subject to UCP 600 without specific reference.
 An eUCP credit must indicate the applicable version of the eUCP.  If not indicated, it is subject to the latest version in effect on the date the eUCP credit is issued or, if made subject to the eUCP by an amendment accepted by the beneficiary, the date of that amendment.
 The Presentation can be all electronic records or a mixture of some paper documents and some electronic records.
 The provisions of eUCP shall prevail to the extent that they would produce a result different from the application of the UCP.
 It comprises of a number of terminologies used in the eUCP V2.0, some also appear in UCP 600, whilst others appear solely in the eUCP V2.0
The requirement for presentation of one or more originals or copies of an electronic record is satisfied by the presentation of one electronic record.
 It provides a method by which corrupted data may be represented.

Banks are liable for their own data processing systems.
 Force majeure article, as the previous versions did not include one.
 Case study for ePresentation
First ePresentation under eUCP using Bolero
At the end of 2010 Bolero announced the first electronic presentation using the Bolero platform to perform fully electronic presentation of documents under a documentary Credit issued subject to eUCP.

The parties involved in the transaction:
The beneficiary BHP Australian mining company, formerly known as (BHP Billiton)
The applicant Tae Kyung Ind. 
Co. 
Ltd. 
in South Korea
The issuing bank Korea Exchange Bank (KEB)
The advising and negotiating bank, The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)
The shipping company “K” Line Pte Ltd.
 The electronic documents sent via Bolero platform by the beneficiary to RBS for pre-checking then as a formal ePresentation, after approval the documents forwarded to KEB and promptly honoured.
 Arthur Vonchek, CEO of Bolero said:
“We are very excited about the success of the live pilot which demonstrates both the reality as well as the substantial opportunities associated with straight through document presentation.”
Mr.  Yutaka Kuge, General Manager, from “K” Line Pte Ltd.  said:
“Electronic BOL’s provide significant benefits to all parties in the supply chain.  For ship-owners specifically, the most notable advantages are a fully traceable audit trail of BOL ownership and faster turnaround of administrative processes around BOL’s by elimination of physical BOL’s getting delayed or even lost during the transfer between the various parties.”
The ePresentation replaces the need for paper documentation, thereby saving the time for all parties involved, while accelerating the working capital cycle through faster and secure payment.
 Summary
Since its origin, more than 85 years, UCP, has governed documentary credits and is considered to be a fundamental component of international trade, as well as, addressing developments in banking, transport and insurance industries and providing great support, comprehensive and practical working assistance to bankers, lawyers, importers, exporters, transporters, academics and all the parties involved in international and domestic trade, so that revision for UCP 600 is a vital matter and will not fade away in order to keep pace with market needs and practices.

URR provides a framework of rules to facilitate the business of documentary credits and the bank-to-bank reimbursement, thereby saving time and costs.
 ISBP serves as an aid to a beneficiary of a documentary credit in its creation and presentation of documents to banks, also it works as a checklist for document checkers to follow in the examination process under documentary credits.
 eUCP provides a framework of rules when dealing in electronic documents under documentary credits and accommodates the technological developments.
 The ICC always makes every effort to keep trade finance flowing smoothly around the world by creating standards and guidelines to avoid the confusion and conflicts between parties and continually adjust and overhaul the rules to reflect the changing nature of banking in trade.

TFG & BAFT Letter of Credit Guide
In the ever-evolving world of global trade, the role of traditional documentary trade instruments like Letters of Credit (LCs), also known as Documentary Credits, becomes increasingly pivotal.  As we navigate through complex macroeconomic terrains and geopolitical uncertainties, LCs provide the industry with security and trust in international transactions.
 This guide is crafted to provide a comprehensive understanding of LCs, from their historical origins to their modern-day application.  It aims to demystify the technicalities of LCs, offering insights into their operational framework, legal underpinnings, and practical usage in trade finance.
 Whether you are a seasoned finance professional or new to trade finance, TFG and BAFT hope that this guide will help you navigate the international trade world.
 TFG and BAFT are thrilled to launch this LC guide at the BAFT 2024 International Trade and Payments Conference in Washington D.C. 
We want to thank David Meynell and Pradeep Taneja for their help in writing this guide, and the BAFT Letter of Credit Working Group for providing their expertise and guidance during the process.
 Why create this guide?
 Recognising the need to demystify this essential trade finance instrument, TFG and BAFT have come together to craft a guide that not only clarifies the basics of Letters of Credit but also breaks down further intricacies of when to use certain documents.
 The aim is to broaden the understanding and use of this tool, removing barriers and fostering a more inclusive global trade environment.
 The guide is the result of a collaborative effort, drawing on the insights and experiences of industry veterans.

Digitalisation and the Future
The UCP 600, while being invaluable in a paper world, is not to be intended to be applied to transactions involving electronic documents.  Over time, traditional trade instruments will inevitably move towards a mixed ecosystem of paper and digital and, ultimately, to electronic records alone.
 With this in mind, the ICC published the eUCP Version 1.0 in 2002 to address the presentation of electronic records under documentary credits.  They issued an update in 2007 known as Version 1.1.  To bring the rules in line with the changes in terminology in UCP 600, the ICC published Version 2.0 in 2019.  Version 2.0 provides a complete update of the rules to ensure ongoing “e-compliance”.
 The latest update, Version 2.1, published in July 2023, aligns the eUCP with the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR) regarding issues of electronic transferable records.  Furthermore, the rules align with the Electronic Trade Documents Act (ETDA) introduced in the UK in September 2023.
 It was recognised at the outset that the likely end of the evolution to electronic presentations would be automated compliance checking systems in the documentary credit field.  This is all too apparent when looking at evolving technology and digital trade finance, with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Smart Contracts, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
 The ICC will continually monitor the content of the eUCP to ensure applicability, with these rules providing many benefits in advancing documentary credits in a digital environment and ensuring the continued relevance of this valuable instrument in mitigating trade risk. 
They have also produced several guides regarding the eUCP, including guidance for buyers and sellers in handling documentary credits subject to the rules.
 The eUCP focuses on the presentation of electronic records, alone or in combination with paper documents, and not on the issuance of an eUCP credit.  This decision was based on the fact that the industry has already issued electronic documentary credits for many years.
 In addition, there was concern that any rules surrounding issuance could encumber present and evolving electronic issuance practices while endangering the rules’ technological neutrality.  The rules are based on the underlying principles in the UCP and standard practice currently existing for eCommerce transactions.
 It is essential to consider the implications of the eUCP when issuing a documentary credit that will provide for the presentation of electronic records solely or in combination with traditional paper documents.  Not doing so could negate many benefits.
 For instance, as with credits solely subject to UCP 600, an applicant must ensure that any request for the issuance of an eUCP credit expressly clarifies and determines the appropriate documentary requirements as agreed with the beneficiary.
 Concerning an eUCP credit, an applicant needs to make several additional considerations.  The fundamental requirement, from which all else will evolve, is to jointly agree with the beneficiary of the credit that presentation of electronic records will be permitted and to determine which documents they can handle in this way.
 During this dialogue, the beneficiary must provide reassurance that it can present any required electronic records and that such documents will be in an acceptable format.  Before finalising the structure, they must also determine that it suits the issuing and nominated banks.

Documentary Collections (DCs)
Documentary Collection (DC) occurs when a seller instructs his bank to forward documents related to the exporting of goods or services to the buyer’s bank, then requesting to present these documents to the buyer for their payment.  The contract will also include the conditions under which conditions the documents can released to the buyer.
 What are Documentary Collections?
 Documentary collections differ from a Letter of Credit (read our blog post on the
differences between DCs and LCs
).
 In the case of a documentary collection, the exporter will request payment by presenting its shipping and collection documents to their remitting bank.  The remitting bank then forwards these documents on to the bank of the importer.  The importers bank will then pay the exporters bank, which will credit those funds to the exporter.
 The role of banks in a documentary collection is limited, they do not verify the documents, take risks, nor do they guarantee payment; banks just control the flow of the documents.
 With documentary collections, the bank does not cover credit and country risk, however, they are more convenient and more cost-effective than Letters of Credit and can be useful if the exporter and importer have a good relationship, and if the importer is situated in a politically and economically stable market.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Rules, Practice, and Law
Risk Mitigation
Issuing a documentary credit is not always a simple formality or an act that can be completed in a standard or recurring manner.  It often requires attention to detail by the corporate parties and, more importantly, to contain precise wording with a single interpretation.
 Documentary credits are transactions prepared according to the specific requirements notified by an applicant, and such provisions should not be restricted to the name of a document but also extend to the data content for that document and, where appropriate, the name of an issuer.
 An applicant should ensure that the instructions it provides to its bank for issuing any documentary credit meet the requirements for specifying the appropriate documentary obligations.  This will enable the smooth importation of the goods and provide a suitable level of assurance regarding the quality, standard and type of goods purchased.

The content of the sales contract, proforma invoice, or purchase order agreed with the seller should, where appropriate, adhere to these instructions.  However, banks will discourage any attempt by the applicant to include, as an
integral
part of the credit, copies of the underlying contract, proforma invoice, or the like.
 Most documentary credit application forms incorporate a choice of the main types of documents under the terms and conditions.  For example, they often include invoices, transport documents, insurance documents, packing lists, and weight lists.
 Applicants are strongly encouraged to provide the name of an entity required to issue each document and its data content.
 UCP 600
ICC rules include the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits, introduced to alleviate disparities between national laws on documentary credit practice.  The ICC published the current version, UCP 600, in 2007.  The ICC do not require banks or countries to indicate adherence to any set of rules as all ICC rules, including UCP 600, are based on the principle that they will apply if the credit is stated to be subject to them.

.

Law
Under most documentary credits, the corporate parties involved are domiciled in different countries.  For this reason, documentary credits subject to the UCP 600 do not state which particular jurisdiction would apply in the event of any issues or disputes.
 However, considering that most documentary credits are issued subject to the UCP 600, a uniform approach is already in place.  This dramatically reduces any variances caused by divergent national laws.

UCP 600 (Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits) – What does UCP 600 mean?
 The Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) is a set of rules agreed by the International Chamber of Commerce, which apply to finance institutions which issue Letters of Credit – financial instruments helping companies finance trade.  Many banks and lenders are subject to this regulation, which aims to standardise international trade, reduce the risks of trading goods and services, and govern trade.
 The UCP 600 (“Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits”) is the official publication which is issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).  It is a set of 39 articles  on issuing and using Letters of Credit, which applies to 175 countries around the world, constituting some $1 trillion USD of trade per year.

What’s the purpose of UCP 600?

The UCP 600 replaced the UCP 500 on the 1st July 2007. 
It was brought about to standardise a set of rules aiming to benefit all parties during a trade finance transaction.  UCP 600 was created by industry experts, and mandated by the Banking Commission, rather than through legislation.  The first UCP was created in 1933 and has been revised by the ICC up to the point of the UCP 600.
 Is the UCP 600 legally binding?
 The UCP 600 rules are voluntarily incorporated into contracts and have to be specifically outlined in trade finance contracts in order to apply.  They also allow flexibility for the international parties involved.
 An accompaniment to the UCP 600 is the International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP), ICC Publication 745.  It assists with understanding whether a document complies with the terms of Letters of Credit.
 Credits that are issued and governed by UCP 600 will be interpreted in line with the entire set of 39 articles contained in UCP 600.  However, exceptions to the rules can be made by express modification or exclusion.
 The UCP 600 are the most successful rules ever developed in relation to trade and most
Letters of Credit
are subject to them.  At the recent
ICC UK Winter Trade Finance Conference
, there was a special programme which addressed the UCP 600. 
This looked at recent developments in industry practice and ICC policy, as well as a review of the latest Banking Commission Opinions.
 Part 1 – What is a Letter of Credit and what are the benefits to its users?
 Summary of the UCP 600
Here are a few of the key elements which make up the UCP 600:
Definition of key terms which are prevalent in international trade (e.g.  honouring [of payments], applicants, banking days, presentation)
How international trade documents (Letters of Credit) can be signed and acknowledged by all parties
The difference between documents, goods and services (and which parties deal with these)
Which parts of a Letter of Credit are negotiable and non-negotiable
How credit works, and how payment is made
How banks can communicate the confirmation of goods (teletransmission)
Transportation of the goods, modes of transport, and who bears responsibility
How to deal with discrepancies, waivers and giving notice
The provision of original documents or electronic copies
Bills of Lading
Insurance and covering the cost of goods
Loss of
shipping
documents in transit
Will the UCP 600 be revised?
 At Trade Finance Global, many people ask whether the UCP 600 will be revised.  The UCP 600 is a set of rules developed by the International Chamber of Commerce on the issuance and governance of Letters of Credit, which account for a significant proportion of global trade finance transactions.

The UCP 600 has taken over 3 years to develop
When looking at the UCP 600, it is important to look at the market environment and general notes about the current guidelines.  It is general consensus that UCP 600 will not be revised any time soon.  Some of the reasons for this and general notes about the UCP are outlined below:
there was a 14 year gap between UCP 500 and UCP 600;
The consulting group was established with 41 members from 26 countries, who held meetings on over 15 occasions
Over 5000 comments were received and reviewed once the first draft of the UCP 600 came about, being unanimously approved in October 2006
UCP 600 is doing relatively well and works most of the time, there have been a low number of disputes, usually centred around some ambiguous wording that could not be agreed when the UCP 600 was drafted;
The big question is, if it were to be revised,
who would draft it and who in the market has the expertise to do so;
revision would take time and be at a high cost;
there is a lot of regulatory uncertainty in the market and policy would need to be drafted before any advancement of the documents;
it is unknown what will happen to various sanctions that are operating in the market;
the ISBP is used to clarify points and there are further opinions that do the same; and
the system will never be perfect as there will always need to be compromise – it covers over 150 trading countries and needs to reflect the commercial and legal realities.

Part 2 – Explanation of the UCP 600 rules and history of UCP
Part 3 – Evolution of UCP 600 rules – will we see UCP 700 rules?

Trade Finance Global interviewed Pradeep Taneja, Managing Director of Taneja Global Trade Consulting, Bahrain and Co-Chairman and Board member of ICC Bahrain to learn more about Letters of Credit.  To read this inteview, click

 Electronic UCP (eUCP)
In 2019, the International Chamber of Commerce also released an updated supplement for the electronic rules (eRules) of the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits.  TFG covered the key changes for V2.0 of the eUCP rules, which can be found

What’s the difference between UCP 600 and UCP 500?
 The UCP 500, was revised in 1993, a process which reviewed and overhauled opinions, decisions, URR525, ISP98 and eUCP.
 Seven key articles were amended.
 In comparison to UCP 500,
New terminology added, concepts & wording introduced
Reorganisation of the rules
Substantive & cosmetic changes
Improved clarity, yet created new ambiguity
Part 4 – 3 tips for using UCP 600 rules in Letters of Credit
What about the eUCP
Recently, the ICC updated eUCP 600 rules (eRules), to accelerate the digitilisation of trade finance.  Trade Finance Global have published the updates on the eRules for ‘eUCP 600’, which are supplementary rules to these UCP 600 rules.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

eUCP Explained
The ICC recently issued a supplement on the latest eRules for the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (eUCP 600).  This is the second version (V2.0).  Here, we summarise the key changes in the eUCP documentation, and how this supplements UCP rules.
 What is UCP?
 The Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (
UCP 600
) is a set of rules agreed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), which apply to finance institutions which issue
Letters of Credit
.  Used by letter of credit practitioners worldwide, UCP are the most successful private rules for trade ever developed.  Bankers, traders, lawyers, transporters, academics and all who deal with letter of credit transactions worldwide will refer to UCP 600 on a daily basis.
 eRules and the eUCP
To advance the digitalisation of trade finance practices , ICC issued new electronic rules (eRules); they came into effect on the 1st of July.  The eRules will be continually monitored and updated to reflect future technological developments and trends that emerge in trade finance.  ICC will ensure that the eRules remain applicable to banks and other trade finance institutions.  Acknowledging the significance of these rules for the work of trade finance professionals, ICC made the full text of
eURC
and
eUCP
available online. 
ICC has also published an in depth
guidance
of the changes in the
eUCP v1.1 to v2.0
and the newly drafted
eURC v 1.0
.

The content of the eRules will be continually monitored in order to ensure they work in the context of electronic documentation and trade.  The eUCP will be continuously reviewed by trade practioners to feed back updates and monitor eUCP in practise.
 In the following page we will provide you with a line by line summary of eUCP v 2.0 and key changes.

URC 522 and eURC Explained
What is URC 522?
 The ICC Uniform Rules for Collections (URC)
are a set of Rules helping all the counterparties in a collection process of debt, owned money or assets.  The rules were created to resolve the daily operational problems of the practitioners.
 In essence, the URC 522 rules outline what banks should do with documents against acceptance (D/A) and documents against payment (D/P).
 Documents against acceptance
are an arrangement between the importer and the exporter, specifying that the importer is not to be given documentation that confirms their ownership of the imported goods until the
Bill of Exchange/ Bill of Lading
has been paid for, or an agreement to pay has been made.
 In such cases, the URC 522 states that the
importer
must accept a time draft from the bank via the exporter, and must then sign, agreeing to pay the
exporter
(seller) at a future point in time.

Once this has been accepted, ownership documentation is then handled by the bank to the buyer.
 Documents against payment
are used in a similar way but on the side of the exporter.  These documents are an agreement between the bank and the exporter, specifying that the importer is not to receive any of the paperwork confirming ownership of goods until the attached Bill of Exchange / Bill of Lading is paid for, or preparations for payment have been made.
 The URC 522 states that the buyer (importer) should make full payment on the goods once they are delivered, after which the documents confirming ownership can be handed over by the bank.
 Why is the electronic presentation for URC (eUCR) needed?
 Under the existing guidance from the ICC, the rules of the URC 522 provide protection to transactions of goods and services overseas.  However, when it comes to electronic transactions, URC 522 rules are somewhat limited.
 It is inevitable digital trade finance will start to enter the mix as we move towards open banking, interoperability and the digitalisation of trade. 
As a result, the ICC have recognised that new rules and guidance should be published to supplement the current URC 522 rules.  These are eRules, and have recently been updated for both
UCP 600
and URC 522.
 What are the benefits of eRules for trade finance?
 Safeguarding applicability in a constantly evolving digital trade sector
Isolating the risk from a physical paper environment to the electronic systems
Supporting the usage of electronic records
Unity as opposed to divergent national and regional practice
Standardisation of terminologies and objectives
Enabling and supporting trade finance between regions and countries regardless of underlying economic and judicial structures
The implementation of the eRules is likely to lead to the evolution of electronic presentations and automated compliance checking systems, a breakthrough in the world of documentary credits.
 With the advent of the Internet of Things, Distributed Ledger Technology, Smart Contracts, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, digital trade finance is changing, and the eRules are looking to accommodate and adapt to these new technologies.

ISBP 821
The International Standard Banking Practice for the Examination of Documents under Documentary Credits (ISBP 821) reflects the existing practice.  It has evolved into a necessary companion to the UCP for determining compliance of documents with the terms of documentary credits.
 It is important to note that the ISBP does not amend the UCP 600.  Instead, it explains how documentary credit practitioners apply practices expressed in the UCP 600.  The ISBP and the UCP should be read in conjunction, not in isolation.
 Incorporating the ISBP into the terms of a documentary credit is inappropriate, as the requirement to follow agreed practices is already implicit within UCP 600.  Applied correctly, the ISBP helps reduce the large percentage of documents refused for discrepancies on the first presentation to a bank.
 The ISBP publication outlines standard practice globally and encompasses an intelligent checklist of procedures for document checkers to examine documents presented under documentary credits.  The intent is to explain how practices articulated in UCP 600 are applied by documentary credit practitioners, thus providing a framework under which a beneficiary may prepare its documents to a standard that can be accepted globally.
 The content of the ISBP 821 comprises:
Preliminary considerations
General principles
Drafts and calculation of maturity date
Invoices
Transport document covering at least two different modes of transport (multimodal or combined transport document)
Bill of lading
Non-negotiable sea waybill
Charter party bill of lading
Air transport document
Road, rail, or inland waterway transport documents

Ensuring Credit-Compliant Presentations of Documents
Trade documents have existed since the dawn of the written word, and archaeologists have recovered ‘documents’ in the form of clay tablets that date back many thousands of years.  Without documents, there is no documentary credit, meaning that a seller does not get paid, and a buyer does not get its goods.
 All parties involved in the trade cycle need documentation, albeit with differing requirements, and each type of document serves a different purpose.
 There are many document types, and it is essential to understand the intent of the documents required under a documentary credit.  Most countries have a minimum requirement for import and export documentation, and many have numerous specific and unique requirements.  Still, practitioners should be aware of and account for these in the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.
 Poorly prepared documents can severely impact a transaction, leading (at best) to delays in settlement. 
Global statistics differ, but the percentage of documents refused by banks on the first presentation ranges between 65% and 80%.
 Discrepancies
While some of the more common discrepancies are due to timing issues (expiry, shipment, and presentation period), quite a few derive from poorly prepared documents or presentations.  These can include conflicting data between documents, missing documents, unauthenticated alterations, missing endorsements, goods descriptions not according to the documentary credit, insurance documents dated later than the transport document, and missing or incorrect shipped-on-board notations.
 As a result of discrepancies in a presentation, practitioners incur additional costs by way of discrepancy fees (from the nominated bank or issuing bank), expenses for communications sent, lost interest, and increased administrative costs.  These will all lead to a reduced profit margin on the transaction.  Discrepancy fees, for example, can be expensive and often range from the equivalent of USD 25 to USD 500 per presentation.

Refusals can lead to banks making no payment in some transactions.  This can be due to a confirming bank or issuing bank refusing to honour or negotiate owing to the perceived financial risk of the issuing bank or applicant.
 Although an applicant may agree to issue a waiver for any discrepancies found in a presentation, the issuing bank is not obligated to accept it.  The issuing bank may continue to refuse to honour the presentation and will be entitled to subsequently return the documents.
 Some applicants will use discrepancies in a presentation to ‘negotiate’ a discount with the respective beneficiary in return for the applicant agreeing to issue its waiver.
 Preparation of Documents
A beneficiary may issue any document except where:
the rules state otherwise,
the documentary credit specifies the name of the issuer, or
the documentary credit refers to the type of issuer as an independent, competent, qualified, or local company.  UCP 600 interprets this as any issuer except the beneficiary.

Beneficiaries can avoid discrepancies in presentation by paying more attention to detail and reducing unnecessary data in the documents.  This is achieved by carefully considering whether to include additional or redundant information on a document and avoiding anything that could call into doubt the compliance of a document.  Only incorporating data required by the terms and conditions of the documentary credit or the ICC rules will significantly increase the likelihood of a presentation being found compliant.
 If in any doubt as to the requirements for the completion of any document, always contact the nominated bank and seek their guidance.  For documents not issued by the beneficiary, provide the relevant freight forwarder, carrier (or its agent), or insurance company with a copy of the documentary credit to ensure they can comply with its instructions.  This should happen before the shipment of the goods.
 If there are any issues, seek an amendment from the applicant and refrain from relying on their stating that the amendment will follow or presenting documents on the basis that they will authorise settlement despite any discrepancy.  If documents are discrepant, there is no undertaking from the issuing bank or any confirming bank.
 ICC Rules
Even before commencing the preparation process, a beneficiary should understand the rules.  In particular, they should be aware of and understand the implications of the content of UCP 600.  It is also recommended that beneficiaries have an understanding of ISBP 821.  The fact that this addresses the examination stage will provide the opportunity to understand the issues that bank document examiners will focus on.
 ISBP 821 additionally makes it clear that the preparation of documents should start early in the chain.  Before issuing the documentary credit, the beneficiary and the applicant should carefully consider the documents required for presentation, by whom they are to be issued, their data content, and the timeframe in which they will be presented.

As an example of the content of ISBP, the publication includes references to misspellings and typing errors.  These can cause all sorts of problems and, in a worst-case scenario, will lead to a refusal of documents.  However, not all misspellings and typing errors make a document discrepant if they do not affect the meaning or intent of a word or sentence.
 Creating a checklist that provides guidelines on the basic requirements for the more common documents is worthwhile to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of a documentary credit.  While an all-inclusive checklist covering every possible documentary requirement is not feasible, providing a generic one covering the typical documents under a documentary credit and the standard information within each document is possible.
 Staff preparing documents should still thoroughly review them before their presentation under the documentary credit.

Dispute Resolution
Examining documents under documentary credits will often result in a difference of opinion as to whether the documents comply and, if considered to be discrepant, which discrepancies are applicable.  In most situations, the discrepancies are apparent and result in no disagreement between the concerned parties.
 Furthermore, although disputes can arise between any involved parties, they can generally resolve such conflicts quickly, without referral to any arbitration or legal process.  However, on occasion, they may involve a third party.
 The choice of dispute resolution will depend on the issues in dispute.  Moreover, it is not advisable to include a reference to a preferred form of dispute resolution in a documentary credit when:
there may be no dispute, but the addition of such a clause will give a false impression regarding the issuing bank (i.e., that there is an anticipation of a dispute arising)
the dispute may be inappropriate for the stated service (e.g., ICC DOCDEX, a named court or jurisdiction, or a named arbitration tribunal)
International Chamber of Commerce
Confronted by numerous and often complex problems in establishing documentary compliance and interpreting rules and document content, parties involved in trade regularly approach the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) for guidance. 
Since 1933, the ICC has made available seven UCP publications, two bank-to-bank reimbursements (URR) publications, five ISBP publications, and numerous guidance and briefing papers.
 In addition, over the last few decades, the ICC Banking Commission has drafted and released hundreds of official opinions in response to questions posed by parties involved in trade activities.  The ICC arbitration service, Documentary Dispute Resolution Expertise (DOCDEX), has also resolved many disputes.
 ICC Opinions
In response to requests for clarification and interpretation for resolving disputes submitted by individuals, banks, corporates, logistics companies, and law firms, the ICC Banking Commission created the “Official ICC Banking Commission Opinions”.  This resource provides expert interpretation and analysis of its rules and transactions issued subject to such ICC rules, including the UCP 600, which are the subject matter of the bulk of ICC opinions.
 Courts often cite ICC Banking Commission Opinions to assist in dispute resolution and are considered a significant resource for lawyers, bankers, judges, scholars and other professionals in the industry. 
The opinions are not binding.  However, they have been used in evidence in court cases for many years to support the position of a defendant or plaintiff.
 ICC DOCDEX
The purpose of DOCDEX is to provide parties with a specific dispute resolution procedure that leads to an independent, impartial, and prompt expert decision in settling disputes.
 The ICC launched this service in 1997 as an alternative dispute resolution system for parties using ICC rules relating to letter of credit transactions.  However, it has now expanded to cover all ICC rules.
 The ICC International Centre for Expertise (Centre) monitors and handles the process.
 Courts and Arbitration
Unfortunately, there are occasions when neither an ICC opinion nor DOCDEX will solve the problem.  In such circumstances, the involved parties may turn to the courts, which can be a costly and time-consuming option and will include a wide range of costs relevant to the legal process.
 It is worth noting that over the years, many courts have used the content of existing ICC opinions and DOCDEX decisions as the basis for their deliberations and conclusions.

An arbitration or mediation service is far more likely to occur in disputes between a buyer and seller relating to a contract of sale than a dispute concerning the status of documents under a documentary credit and the UCP.

Contents
Types of Credit
There are several types of documentary credits, each with its own characteristics.
 Sight Credits
With sight credits,
the nominated bank (
acting on its nomination),
the confirming bank
, or
the issuing bank
effects payment upon presentation of the documents (also called “at sight”), provided documents comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.
 Usance Credits
Under usance credits,
the issuing bank
undertakes to honour a compliant presentation at
a future date
(known as the “maturity date”).  There are two types of usance credits:
Acceptance credits
: A documentary credit stipulating the presentation of a bill of exchange (“draft”) which the bank will accept and pay at maturity to
the beneficiary
.
 Deferred payment credits
: Same as
acceptance credits
, except that they do not require the presentation of a draft.
 Mixed Payment Credits
Practitioners use mixed payment credits when a partial amount is payable at sight while the remainder is payable at a future date (or dates) as per the documentary credit terms.

Since these credits comprise a mix of sight and usance credits, they are known as mixed payment credits.
 Negotiation Credits
A negotiation credit is the purchase by the nominated bank of drafts (drawn on a bank other than the nominated bank) and/or documents under a complying presentation, by advancing or agreeing to advance funds to the beneficiary on or before the banking day on which reimbursement is due to the nominated bank.
 Confirmed Credits
Confirmed credits are those that also bear
the confirming bank’s
irrevocable undertaking (in addition to that of
the issuing bank)
to honour or negotiate, without recourse, documents complying with the terms and conditions of the credit.
 Transferable credits
If
the beneficiary
(i.e., the “first beneficiary”) of a documentary credit is an intermediary trader that procures the goods from another source, they may request the buyer to provide a transferable credit, which the first beneficiary can then transfer to its supplier (i.e., the “second beneficiary”). 
A transferable documentary credit must expressly state that it is transferable and provide the name of the nominated bank or the bank authorised to transfer.
 To transfer the credit,
the first beneficiary
will request that
the nominated
or
authorised bank
transfer the documentary credit to
the second beneficiary
in whole or in part.
 The first beneficiary
can request transfer to multiple
second beneficiaries,
provided the documentary credit allows for partial shipments.  However,
the second beneficiary
cannot transfer the documentary credit to another subsequent beneficiary.
 Under UCP 600, the transfer must be effected on the existing terms and conditions except for the amount, the unit price if given, the expiry date, and the latest date of shipment or period for presentation, all of which can be reduced.  Furthermore, the name of
the first beneficiary
can be substituted with
the applicant’s
.  If the documentary credit requires the presentation of an insurance document, the amount or the percentage of insurance can be increased to provide cover as initially required under the documentary credit.
 The first beneficiary
has the right to provide its invoice in substitution of
the second beneficiary’s invoice
and draw for the difference in amount, if any.  However, if it fails to provide its invoice,
the transferring bank
can forward documents received from
the second beneficiary
to
the issuing bank
.
 Back-to-back Credits
Back-to-back documentary credits serve the same purpose as transferable credits.  However, instead of transferring the original documentary credit to its supplier,
the beneficiary
requests that its bank issue a new one in favour of its supplier.  Practitioners call these back-to-back credits, as banks issue them on the back of an original documentary credit.
 A back-to-back credit is separate and independent from the original documentary credit. 
While
the issuing bank
of the back-to-back documentary credit must honour a complying presentation received under its documentary credit, the payment under the original is contingent on the ability of
the beneficiary
of the original documentary credit to provide documents in compliance with the terms and conditions.
 Instalment Credits
Instalment credits stipulate a shipment schedule with specific quantities or dates by which the goods will be shipped.
 A unique feature of these credits is that if one instalment is not shipped within the stipulated period, the entire credit is no longer available for any subsequent instalments (not just for that specific instalment).
 Revolving Credits
When buyers place repeat orders with the same sellers for the same goods at the same price and with the same terms and conditions, instead of issuing a new credit every time, they can agree with their suppliers to issue revolving credits.
 These credits are ‘revolved’ – either automatically or through a notice of reinstatement from
the issuing bank
– under the terms and conditions of the existing drawing.

The parties can agree to stipulate the number of times, the maximum amount, or the latest date up to which a revolving credit will automatically be reinstated.
 Advance Payment Credits
Typically, documentary credits provide payments to
the beneficiary
at the post-shipment stage upon presentation of documents complying with the terms and conditions.  However, it is possible to provide advance payment to
the beneficiary
at the pre-shipment stage in anticipation of
the beneficiary
presenting documents after shipping the goods.
 To accomplish this, the credit allows the beneficiary to draw for up to a specified amount by simply presenting a receipt.  The amount of any advance payment must then be deducted from invoice amounts as goods are shipped.
 Financiers can provide pre-shipment finance through two types of advance payment credits:
1.
 Red clause documentary credits
: These credits contain a clause authorising
the nominated bank
to extend an advance payment to
the beneficiary.
 The bank can release a set value at the pre-shipment stage to help
the beneficiary
procure the raw material, process, manufacture, pack, and export the goods. 
The advance payment is settled later by the submission of credit-compliant documents by the beneficiary covering the relevant shipment of goods.
 Banks historically typed this clause in red ink when credits were issued in letter form.
 2.
 Green clause documentary credits
: These credits are similar to red clause documentary credits.  However, in addition to extending advance payment to
the beneficiary
at the pre-shipment stage, green clause documentary credits also include additional coverage of pre-shipment warehousing and insurance costs.
 Standby Letters of Credit
Standby letters of credit (SBLCs) are used for a variety of purposes, such as to support an applicant’s performance obligations (performance standby), to support an applicant’s bid in a tender (bid-bond standby), to guarantee an applicant’s financial obligations to the beneficiary, which can also be a bank (financial standby), or to guarantee the performance of a commercial contract (advance payment guarantee).
 Practitioners also use SBLCs to support open account transactions where a seller ships the goods directly to the buyer, and the buyer is expected to make the payment directly to the seller. 
If the buyer fails to pay when due, the beneficiary can draw on the SBLC.

Generally, standby credits are not expected to be drawn on, hence the name.  SBLCs are akin to guarantees since, in the case of the applicant’s default or non-fulfilment of its contractual obligations, the beneficiary of an SBLC can draw under the SBLC by claiming on
the issuing bank
or
the confirming bank
as per the terms and conditions of the SBLC.
 Typically,
the beneficiary’s
claim must be supported by documents such as its statement confirming the applicant’s default, copies of unpaid invoices, or copies of transport documents as required in the SBLC.
 Although many documentary credits are often issued subject to UCP 600, UCP 600 has limited applicability to SBLCs as not all articles of UCP 600 apply to SBLCs.  The International Standby Practices of 1998 (“ISP98”) (ICC publication no 590) provides a separate and exclusive set of rules governing SBLCs issued subject to ISP98.

A Restricted Letter of Credit is where the issuing bank of the LC only lets the customer redeem the LC from a specific bank.
 What is the procedure of the beneficiary banks (not a negotiating bank) if there is a restricted Letter of Credit (LC)?
 The bank could tell the beneficiary to present documents to the negotiating bank along with instructions.  Documents should then be presented to the negotiating bank requesting acceptance (or payment) as outlined by the LC.  This would save costs and time.
 The reason that costs are saved is that both banks will be familiar with each others process of handling the documents.
 Prior to the beneficiary’s bank forwarding the documents through banking channels, they would usually charge fees to perform a document examination service for the beneficiary.  This document checking is not strictly necessary.
 It is important to mention that the non-nominated bank does not have any extra security or protection.  A document examination service could be offered by the bank but if the bank has not included such examination, then it will be a “silent” confirmation and the beneficiary will have limited recourse against such bank.  This will include potential problems, such as the dishonour by the nominated bank or even potential loss of documents when they are sent from the beneficiary’s bank. 
It can also be viewed an advantage if documents are presented through a banker, so that KYC and AML are covered.

The non-nominated bank will not get protection under UCP, but if the documents are credit compliant then they should get paid on the maturity date.
 Where can problems occur with Restricted Letters of Credit?
 There may be difficulties where the beneficiary’s bank does not have SWIFT authentication arrangements with the opening bank.  This is why the opening bank will send the LC to their correspondent in the beneficiary’s country and restrict the LC to that correspondent.
 What are examples of Restricted L/Cs?
 An LC may be provided which restricts presentation to a client’s bank and allows them to confirm.  It may outline that presentation may not be made at any specific banks.
 An LC may be restricted to a bank whose London office is the drawee and also the financing and the issuing bank.  The beneficiary would deal with the bank and would not maintain their account there, this may be due to the reason that they had wanted to use another bank as the confirming bank due to the better rate they offered.
 Another example is a client waiting for an LC from a developing country where there are inherent risks in the transactions.  The counter party is from a developed country but the client does not know who the LC will be advised through.  It may be that a restricted LC is favoured due to the issuing bank and country risk, along with the infancy of banking networks.
 It is often beyond the beneficiary’s control as to which correspondent bank is selected by the issuing bank and why they might restrict it.

Can the bank directly send the documents to the LC issuing Bank without going through the negotiating bank?

Yes. 
UCP600 sub-article 6a and 6d (ii) – If the primary contract is between the issuing bank and the beneficiary and the nominated bank/advising banks/confirming banks are utilised only for the beneficiary’s benefit.  If the beneficiary chooses to forego the services of these additional agents and deal with the issuing bank directly that remains the beneficiary’s prerogative.

 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Bank Guarantee vs.  Letter of Credit: What’s the difference?
 Both the Bank Guarantee and a Letter of Credit (LCs) build trust between parties and reduce risks of non-payment between a buyer (importer) and the supplier (exporter).  However there are slight differences in their purpose and use in international trade.
 Letter of Credit
What is an LC?
 An LC is a contract via a bank that helps guarantee the payment of a supplier as long as the supplier meets the conditions agreed upon in the LC.
 In an LC, the buyer and seller will enter a sales contract, and the buyer (importer) will apply for a letter of credit with their bank (issuing bank),  which will be sent to the supplier’s bank (advising bank).
 If accepted, the supplier will deliver goods that meet the requirements and standards made out in the LC and will send confirming documents to their advising bank.
 The advising bank will pass this on to the issuing bank, and the buyer will examine and honour or refuse payment.
 There are different types of letter of credit, which will you can
see here
.  For more information on
LCs please click here
Bank Guarantee (BG)
What is a bank guarantee?
 Parties to a trade transaction can use bank guarantees to demonstrate the ability to perform duties in their transaction.  The bank’s role can be characterised as minimizing the losses to parties if the counter-party is unable to fulfill their roles stipulated in the contract.

Both parties can apply for bank guarantees and the bank guarantees can come in multiple forms.  Normally in the process, if one party fails, the other party can then invoke the bank guarantee by filing a claim with the bank and receiving the guaranteed amount.
 Some umbrella examples are whether a bank guarantee is performance or financial-based.
 Performance-based:
If the supplier is unable to meet contractural obligations as pertains to the delivery of goods, for example, the quality or quantity of goods.  The buyer can file a claim to the value of goods that is owed to the buyer or as agreed in the bank guarantee.
 Finance-based guarantees:
If a buyer (importer) is unable to pay the supplier (exporter), the supplier can file a claim, and the bank will pay the supplier.
 The guaranteed amount and what constitutes a break in the contract will be stipulated in the bank guarantee.  The agreed amount to be paid is referred to as the guaranteed amount and will always fall in favour of a beneficiary.

Summary of types
Bank Guarantees
Bid Guarantee
.  In this case, the bid bond shows that the supplier is creditworthy and that if the buyer has paid for goods and the supplier fails to deliver on the contract, the buyer can be reimbursed through a guarantee.
 Performance Guarantees:
If a supplier doesn’t meet obligations under the contract, the bank can step in a repay the buyer.
 Advance Payment Guarantee:
The bank will pay the importer, if the exporter doesn’t meet contractual obligations, repaying the payments made by the buyer to the supplier.
 Deferred Payment Guarantee:
The payment is made at a set number of days after a defined event in the transaction, both the date and event being stipulated in the guarantee.
 Shipping Guarantee:
This is most commonly taken out under an LC.  In the event that an importer has not received the bills of lading (BL) when the goods have in the port.  The importer can ask for a shipping guarantee issued by the bank.  They can present this to move the goods out of port without presenting the BL. 
Increasing speed through the port, reducing costs from loss of perishable goods value and
demurrage charges
.
 Letter of Indemnity (LOI):
This will be taken out in the event that bills of lading hasn’t been received before the arrival of goods at the port.  Carriers will ask for LOI.  Without an LOI carriers may not be covered by their Protection and indemnity insurance (P&I).  An LOI can be obtained from a bank or insurance company.  LOI does not remove carriers liability.
 Letters of credit
Import LC:
Secures the means of payment to the supplier through the issuing bank, and the buyer will only have to pay once the documents stipulated in the LC are presented by the supplier.  You can negotiate longer terms of payments with the supplier, for example using a Usance LC.
 Usance LC:
Payment will be made by the buyer’s issuing bank to the supplier at a later date stipulated in the contract.  This allows the buyer time to use the goods productively and send payment.
 Export LC:
Issuing bank, or the confirming bank will guarantee payments if the conditions in the LC are met and the exporter has provided the confirming document.s
Irrevocable LC:
A buyer can cancel or amend the LC, as long as both parties agree.  This allows them to enter into a new LC if the sales contract changes or the circumstances of the transaction. 
The LC also cannot be revoked by the issuing bank without the beneficiary’s consent.
 Confirmed LC:
The supplier can ask their bank to take on the risk of non-payment in the LC.
 Once the bank has received the required documents to meet conditions in the LC, the bank will send money to the supplier.  Even if the buyer or issuing bank is unable to pay the amount stipulated in the LC.  This normally incurs a charge made by the bank to the supplier dependent on the credit risk of the issuing bank.
 Unconfirmed LC:
If conditions in the LC are met, payment to the supplier is the responsibility of the buyers issuing bank.  The risk on non-payment is with the issuing bank, which is usually a foreign bank. 
This is cheaper than a confirmed LC.

A special thank you to Peter Sproston for his additional comments.

FAQ
Why would an Importer want an LC?
 The LC has the outcome of providing confidence that the supplier (exporter) will send goods up to the standard and date required by the buyer (importer).  If the correct documentation isn’t confirmed and accepted by the banks and the buyer, the supplier will not receive payment
Why would an exporter want an LC?
 From the point of view of an exporter, it provides trust that the importer creditworthy because the importers issuing bank will have undergone due diligence to check the creditworthiness of the buyer.
 Why would an importer want a bank guarantee?
 Bank Guarantees may be used in international trade when bidding for commercial contracts.  An importer may ask for a bank guarantee from the exporter to secure a bid.
 It provides the importer with confidence because a bank guarantee from the exporter can be tailored so that if the exporter fails to meet the contractual obligations of the bid then the importer can be reimbursed by the bank.

Furthermore, from the point of view of the importer, the fact that a supplier can take out a bank guarantee means the exporter has a relationship with a bank and is more trustworthy.
 Why would an exporter want a bank guarantee?
 From an exporter’s point of view, the importers application for a bank guarantee helps protect exporters from non-payment and instills confidence in the transaction.  This is because the importer’s bank will have completed due diligence on the importer before creating the bank guarantee, this means that the bank has checked the creditworthiness of the importer.
 The exporter can request a bank guarantee from the importer.  This bank guarantee will mean that the supplier will receive payment from the bank if the buyer is unable to pay.
 What are the critical differences?
 In the case of late payments, with bank guarantees, the bank will only step in if the party is unable to meet obligations in the contract before the bank steps in, so can still lead to late payments.  Whereas the date of payment is already set in an LC, so the issuing bank or confirming bank is more likely to pay on time.
 For bank guarantees, because both parties can take out bank guarantees, both are protected if either party fails to meet their contractual obligations.
 Furthermore, another distinctive difference between the two instruments is that Bank Guarantees are more costly than their counterpart.  This is due to its ability to protect both parties in the transaction, and also due to the Bank Guarantee covering a wider range of higher value transactions.

Why would an Importer want an LC?
 The LC has the outcome of providing confidence that the supplier (exporter) will send goods up to the standard and date required by the buyer (importer).  If the correct documentation isn’t confirmed and accepted by the banks and the buyer, the supplier will not receive payment

What is a Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC / SLOC)?
 A Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC / SLOC) is a guarantee that is made by a bank on behalf of a client, which ensures payment will be made even if their client cannot fulfill the payment.  It is a payment of last resort from the bank, and ideally, is never meant to be used.
 How can a contractual SBLC be used and how does it work?
 An SBLC is frequently used as a safety mechanism for the beneficiary, in an attempt to hedge out
risks
associated with the trade.  Simplistically, it is a guarantee of payment which will be issued by a bank on the behalf of a client.  It is also perceived as a “payment of last resort” due to the circumstances under which it is called upon.  The SBLC prevents contracts from going unfulfilled if a business declares bankruptcy or cannot otherwise meet financial obligations.
 Furthermore, the presence of an SBLC is usually seen as a sign of good faith as it provides proof of the buyer’s credit quality and the ability to make payment.  In order to set this up, a short underwriting duty is performed to ensure the credit quality of the party that is looking for a letter of credit.  Once this has been performed, a notification is then sent to the bank of the party who requested the
Letter of Credit
(typically the seller).
 In the case of a default, the counter-party may have part of the finance paid back by the issuing bank under an SBLC.  Standby Letter of Credits are used to promote confidence in companies because of this.
 How can you apply for a Standby Letter of Credit?
 There are many aspects that a bank will take into consideration when applying for a Standby Letter of Credit, however, the main part will be whether the amount that is being guaranteed can be repaid. 
Essentially, it is an insurance mechanism to the company that is being contracted with.
 As it is insurance, there may be collateral that is needed in order to protect the bank in a default scenario – this may be with cash or assets such as property.  The level of collateral required by the bank and by the size of the SBLC will largely depend on the risk involved, and the strength of the business.
 Other Application steps
There are other standard due diligence questions asked, as well as information requests regarding assets of the business and even possibly the owners.  Upon receipt and review of the documentation, the bank will typically provide a letter to the business owner.  Once the letter has been provided, a fee is then payable by the business owner for each yeah that the Standby Letter of Credit remains outstanding.
 What are the fees for Standby Letters of Credit?
 It is standard for a fee to be between 1-10% of the SBLC value.  In the event that the business meets the contractual obligations prior to the due date, it is possible for an SBLC to be ended with no further charges.

What is the difference between SBLCs and LCs?

A Standby Letter of Credit is different from a Letter of Credit.  An SBLC is paid when called on after conditions have not been fulfilled.  However, a Letter of Credit is the guarantee of payment when certain specifications are met and documents received from the selling party.
 Letters of credit promote trust in a transaction, due to the nature of international dealings, distance, knowledge of another party and legal differences.
 How do SBLCs work in Cross-Border trade?
 Where goods are sold to a counter-party in another country, they may have used an SBLC to ensure their seller will be paid.  In the event that there is non-payment, the seller will present the SBLC to the buyer’s bank so that payment is received.
 A performance SBLC makes sure that the criteria surrounding the trade such as suitability and quality of goods are met.
 We sometimes see SBLCs in construction contracts as the build must fulfill many quality and time specifications.  In the event that the contractor does not fulfill these specifications then there is no need to prove loss or have long protracted negotiations; the SBLC is provided to the bank and payment is then received.

FAQ
What is a negotiable or transferrable letter of credit?
 Letters of credit are sometimes referred to as negotiable or transferrable.  The issuing bank will pay a beneficiary or a bank that is nominated by the beneficiary.  As the beneficiary has this power, they may ‘transfer’ or ‘assign’ the proceeds of a letter of credit to another company.
 Can a letter of credit also be discounted (like an invoice)?
 Yes – if it is a transferable letter of credit and it is a deferred instrument then this may be likely.  This is so that the funder will provide the beneficiary with a discounted value just after the terms of the letter of credit have been fulfilled.
 How can you fund a Standby Letter of Credit?
 In order to issue a standby letter of credit, a bank will typically require a pledge of cash as collateral.  There is a fee that is collected for this service, which is usually priced at a percentage of the letter of credit value.
 How are Letters of Credit governed?
 The International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits governs the way in which these instruments operate.

Could there be non-payment under an SBLC?
 An SBLC will be paid in the event that the bank providing the instrument is still in operation and the beneficiary meets the criteria under the letter.
 What if the bank fails or I don’t trust it?
 When there is genuine worry that the bank will not pay out, then a confirmed letter of credit may be used.  This will be where a ‘stronger’ bank confirms the letter of credit.
 What is a negotiable or transferrable letter of credit?
 Letters of credit are sometimes referred to as negotiable or transferrable.  The issuing bank will pay a beneficiary or a bank that is nominated by the beneficiary.  As the beneficiary has this power, they may ‘transfer’ or ‘assign’ the proceeds of a letter of credit to another company.

Sight LCs – Sight Letter of Credit
Sight LC
stands for Sight Letter of Credit, but before we get into the details of the topic, let us find out what letters of credit (“
LCs
”) are.
 Letter of Credit
Letters of Credit include
Sight LCs
that rely on underlying documentation.  The beneficiary must submit certain documents to the specific bank/s in order to get paid.  A letter of credit is typically the document that governs the requirements for payment.  Other documentation must prove that the exporter met the obligation towards the buyer.
 Think of a letter of credit as a payment tool.  However, it is separate from a sales or purchase agreement.  A letter of credit helps to ensure that the party on the other end of a deal obliges and performs specific tasks expected of them.
 A bank works as an intermediary guarantor for payment and holds the money until it gets proof that the requirements stated in the letter of credit were satisfied. 
To set up and draft a documentary LC, the party that will make the payment applies for an LC with a local bank of their choice.
 In case you are a seller dealing with overseas buyers, using a letter of credit can help you gain confidence.  A properly drafted LC will ensure that you get paid as long as you fulfill the requirements mentioned in the document.
 What Is a Sight LC?
 A sight letter of credit is a document that guarantees the payment against any services or goods that are being delivered.  The amount is payable when the party presents the
Sight LC
along with other necessary documents.
 A company offering a sight letter of credit commits to pay an agreed amount of money to the other party when all of the provisions in the LC are met.
 This means a
Sight LC
provides both the buyer and seller in a transaction some level of protection.  Plus, it helps decrease some significant risks involved in conducting business, especially if you are dealing with an international client, either buyer or seller.
 Always remember, a
Sight LC
will involve three parties, i.e., seller, buyer, and the bank issuing letter of credit.
 How Sight Letters of Credit Work?
 It is relatively simple to understand how a
Sight LC
works.  A third party, typically a bank, provides a letter of credit with a guarantee to pay the agreed payment once the other party renders the desired products or services.

Sight LCs
list precise conditions when the bank can release the payment to the service provider.  These conditions may include certain documentation requirements along with an acceptable timeline for the delivery of goods.
 Proof of shipment is one of the required documents to release the payment.  The payment requesting party must present this proof directly to the LC issuing bank.
 It is important to remember that an LC is a separate document from other negotiated contracts that are part of a business transaction.  However, it still requires both parties to agree upon the LC terms and conditions.  As a business, you can use it for either national or international transactions.
 However, parties mostly use an LC for international sales transactions.  Why?  It protects both buyers and sellers and moves the risk away from them, by having an intermediary bank involved in a business transaction from start to finish.
 When a Sight Letter of Credit Becomes Due?
 A
Sight LC
becomes payable as soon as the beneficiary provides the required documents to the bank, fulfilling the conditions of the sight letter of credit.  However, the bank gets a reasonable time to process the requested payment.  This time typically goes up to five business days.
 The required documents may include either proof of delivery or proof of shipment for the products purchased by a buyer, as a
Sight LC
protects both buyer and seller by decreasing any risk involved in international trading.  If a seller expresses any concerns about receiving their payment, they can demand a
Sight LC
as it will become an insurance policy.
 One of the most common examples of the effectiveness of sight letters of credit is as follows:
A business owner can present a
Sight LC
along with a bill of exchange to a lender and walk away with all the necessary funds on the spot. 
This makes
Sight LCs
an important document in the trading arena, and it enjoys more popularity than any other type of letter of credit.
 Difference between Sight LC and Time LC
A lot of business owners get confused between
Sight LC
and time letter of credit.  Although both require certain documents, and both are common practice within the trading arena, there is a slight difference between the two.
 A sight LC becomes due as soon as the beneficiary presents the proof of delivery or proof of shipment, and other ancillary documents.  On the other hand, a Time LC needs certain days to pass after submitting a letter of credit, proof of delivery or shipment, and other required documents, before the payment becomes due.
 There are several advantages of a sight letter of credit, such as:
Efficient Working Capital Management for the Seller
The sellers get the flexibility to manage their working capital with efficacy.  One of the most lucrative advantages of a Sight LC is that the seller can expect to receive the payment against the products quickly and as soon as the shipment of goods is on its way.

Consequently, the seller will not have to experience a cash crunch; and so the seller can efficiently manage his working capital.
 Early Payment Benefits
Sight letters of credit come with an interesting benefit for the seller.  Typically, a business uses a working capital loan or an overdraft facility to manage their working capital.  This scenario becomes inevitable when the seller extends a credit period to a buyer.  The credit period may be for a duration of 15 to 90 days.  This extension of credit and thus cash gap is not relevant where there is an LC, as a Sight LC guarantees that the seller will get paid earlier.
 Competitive Advantage for the Buyers
As a buyer does not take any credit period from the selling party, they are in a better position to negotiate competitive prices and terms with a seller.  This gives a competitive edge to the buyer in the trade market.

Bank Guarantee vs.  Letter of Credit: What’s the difference?
 Both the Bank Guarantee and a Letter of Credit (LCs) build trust between parties and reduce risks of non-payment between a buyer (importer) and the supplier (exporter).  However there are slight differences in their purpose and use in international trade.
 Letter of Credit
What is an LC?
 An LC is a contract via a bank that helps guarantee the payment of a supplier as long as the supplier meets the conditions agreed upon in the LC.
 In an LC, the buyer and seller will enter a sales contract, and the buyer (importer) will apply for a letter of credit with their bank (issuing bank),  which will be sent to the supplier’s bank (advising bank).
 If accepted, the supplier will deliver goods that meet the requirements and standards made out in the LC and will send confirming documents to their advising bank.
 The advising bank will pass this on to the issuing bank, and the buyer will examine and honour or refuse payment.
 There are different types of letter of credit, which will you can
see here
.  For more information on
LCs please click here
Bank Guarantee (BG)
What is a bank guarantee?
 Parties to a trade transaction can use bank guarantees to demonstrate the ability to perform duties in their transaction.  The bank’s role can be characterised as minimizing the losses to parties if the counter-party is unable to fulfill their roles stipulated in the contract.

Both parties can apply for bank guarantees and the bank guarantees can come in multiple forms.  Normally in the process, if one party fails, the other party can then invoke the bank guarantee by filing a claim with the bank and receiving the guaranteed amount.
 Some umbrella examples are whether a bank guarantee is performance or financial-based.
 Performance-based:
If the supplier is unable to meet contractural obligations as pertains to the delivery of goods, for example, the quality or quantity of goods.  The buyer can file a claim to the value of goods that is owed to the buyer or as agreed in the bank guarantee.
 Finance-based guarantees:
If a buyer (importer) is unable to pay the supplier (exporter), the supplier can file a claim, and the bank will pay the supplier.
 The guaranteed amount and what constitutes a break in the contract will be stipulated in the bank guarantee.  The agreed amount to be paid is referred to as the guaranteed amount and will always fall in favour of a beneficiary.

Summary of types
Bank Guarantees
Bid Guarantee
.  In this case, the bid bond shows that the supplier is creditworthy and that if the buyer has paid for goods and the supplier fails to deliver on the contract, the buyer can be reimbursed through a guarantee.
 Performance Guarantees:
If a supplier doesn’t meet obligations under the contract, the bank can step in a repay the buyer.
 Advance Payment Guarantee:
The bank will pay the importer, if the exporter doesn’t meet contractual obligations, repaying the payments made by the buyer to the supplier.
 Deferred Payment Guarantee:
The payment is made at a set number of days after a defined event in the transaction, both the date and event being stipulated in the guarantee.
 Shipping Guarantee:
This is most commonly taken out under an LC.  In the event that an importer has not received the bills of lading (BL) when the goods have in the port.  The importer can ask for a shipping guarantee issued by the bank.  They can present this to move the goods out of port without presenting the BL. 
Increasing speed through the port, reducing costs from loss of perishable goods value and
demurrage charges
.
 Letter of Indemnity (LOI):
This will be taken out in the event that bills of lading hasn’t been received before the arrival of goods at the port.  Carriers will ask for LOI.  Without an LOI carriers may not be covered by their Protection and indemnity insurance (P&I).  An LOI can be obtained from a bank or insurance company.  LOI does not remove carriers liability.
 Letters of credit
Import LC:
Secures the means of payment to the supplier through the issuing bank, and the buyer will only have to pay once the documents stipulated in the LC are presented by the supplier.  You can negotiate longer terms of payments with the supplier, for example using a Usance LC.
 Usance LC:
Payment will be made by the buyer’s issuing bank to the supplier at a later date stipulated in the contract.  This allows the buyer time to use the goods productively and send payment.
 Export LC:
Issuing bank, or the confirming bank will guarantee payments if the conditions in the LC are met and the exporter has provided the confirming document.s
Irrevocable LC:
A buyer can cancel or amend the LC, as long as both parties agree.  This allows them to enter into a new LC if the sales contract changes or the circumstances of the transaction. 
The LC also cannot be revoked by the issuing bank without the beneficiary’s consent.
 Confirmed LC:
The supplier can ask their bank to take on the risk of non-payment in the LC.
 Once the bank has received the required documents to meet conditions in the LC, the bank will send money to the supplier.  Even if the buyer or issuing bank is unable to pay the amount stipulated in the LC.  This normally incurs a charge made by the bank to the supplier dependent on the credit risk of the issuing bank.
 Unconfirmed LC:
If conditions in the LC are met, payment to the supplier is the responsibility of the buyers issuing bank.  The risk on non-payment is with the issuing bank, which is usually a foreign bank. 
This is cheaper than a confirmed LC.

A special thank you to Peter Sproston for his additional comments.

FAQ
Why would an Importer want an LC?
 The LC has the outcome of providing confidence that the supplier (exporter) will send goods up to the standard and date required by the buyer (importer).  If the correct documentation isn’t confirmed and accepted by the banks and the buyer, the supplier will not receive payment
Why would an exporter want an LC?
 From the point of view of an exporter, it provides trust that the importer creditworthy because the importers issuing bank will have undergone due diligence to check the creditworthiness of the buyer.
 Why would an importer want a bank guarantee?
 Bank Guarantees may be used in international trade when bidding for commercial contracts.  An importer may ask for a bank guarantee from the exporter to secure a bid.
 It provides the importer with confidence because a bank guarantee from the exporter can be tailored so that if the exporter fails to meet the contractual obligations of the bid then the importer can be reimbursed by the bank.

Furthermore, from the point of view of the importer, the fact that a supplier can take out a bank guarantee means the exporter has a relationship with a bank and is more trustworthy.
 Why would an exporter want a bank guarantee?
 From an exporter’s point of view, the importers application for a bank guarantee helps protect exporters from non-payment and instills confidence in the transaction.  This is because the importer’s bank will have completed due diligence on the importer before creating the bank guarantee, this means that the bank has checked the creditworthiness of the importer.
 The exporter can request a bank guarantee from the importer.  This bank guarantee will mean that the supplier will receive payment from the bank if the buyer is unable to pay.
 What are the critical differences?
 In the case of late payments, with bank guarantees, the bank will only step in if the party is unable to meet obligations in the contract before the bank steps in, so can still lead to late payments.  Whereas the date of payment is already set in an LC, so the issuing bank or confirming bank is more likely to pay on time.
 For bank guarantees, because both parties can take out bank guarantees, both are protected if either party fails to meet their contractual obligations.
 Furthermore, another distinctive difference between the two instruments is that Bank Guarantees are more costly than their counterpart.  This is due to its ability to protect both parties in the transaction, and also due to the Bank Guarantee covering a wider range of higher value transactions.

Why would an Importer want an LC?
 The LC has the outcome of providing confidence that the supplier (exporter) will send goods up to the standard and date required by the buyer (importer).  If the correct documentation isn’t confirmed and accepted by the banks and the buyer, the supplier will not receive payment

Understanding MT 700: The Documentary Credit Message
The MT 700 is a crucial message type in international trade finance, transmitted via SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) to convey the terms and conditions of a documentary credit. 
This page breaks down the MT 700 format, highlighting its structure, network-validated rules, and usage guidelines to provide a comprehensive overview.
 Who uses MT 700 and why?
 The users of MT 700
The MT 700 message is extensively used by banks and financial institutions engaged in international trade finance.  Specifically, it is issued by the originating bank, which opens the documentary credit on behalf of the applicant (typically a buyer or importer) and is sent to the advising bank, usually located in the beneficiary’s (the seller or exporter) country.  This critical financial document plays a vital role in facilitating secure and efficient transactions across borders, ensuring that all parties involved adhere to any agreed-upon terms and conditions.
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
Reasons for using MT 700
The primary reason for using an MT 700 is to provide a secure and standardised method for communicating the details of a documentary credit.  This SWIFT message type guarantees that the terms of the credit are clearly understood and agreed upon by all parties, thereby minimising the risk of disputes and misunderstandings.
 It is an essential tool for mitigating risks in international trade, as it assures the seller of receiving payment under the specified conditions, while the buyer is assured that payment will only be made upon the fulfilment of these conditions. 
The MT 700 thus facilitates smoother, more reliable trade transactions by providing a framework within which trust can be established between international trading partners.
 MT 700 format specifications
Scope: Issued by the bank opening the documentary credit (issuing bank) and sent to the bank advising the credit (advising bank), the MT 700 details the terms under which the credit has been issued.
 Status and Structure:
Mandatory (M) and Optional (O) tags indicate whether a field must be filled in.
 The format includes a range of fields from “Sequence of Total” to “Sender to Receiver Information,” each with specific content requirements and options.
 Key fields explained
27 – Sequence of Total & 20 – Documentary Credit Number:
Provide a sequence for messages related to the same credit and a unique identifier for the credit, respectively.
 31C – Date of Issue & 31D – Date and Place of Expiry:
Specify the timeframe within which the credit is valid, from issuance to expiry.
 50 – Applicant & 59 – Beneficiary:
Identify the parties initiating and benefiting from the credit.
 32B – Currency Code, Amount:
Details the credit amount and the currency it’s denominated in.
 49 – Confirmation Instructions:
Relays whether the advising bank is to add its confirmation to the credit.
 Network Validated Rules
C1 & C2:
Stipulate that certain fields, such as 42C (Drafts at…) and 42a (Drawee), must be used in conjunction and specify allowed combinations of fields to accurately convey payment details and conditions.
 C3:
Dictates the exclusive presence of either field 44C (Latest Date of Shipment) or 44D (Shipment Period), emphasising the importance of clear shipment timelines.
 Usage rules
Document length:
For documentary credits requiring extensive explanation, additional information is to be communicated through MT 701 messages, ensuring comprehensive coverage without repetition.

Operative credit instrument:
Emphasises that, unless otherwise specified, a documentary credit communicated via MT 700 is deemed operative, underlining the message’s binding nature in trade finance operations.
 Field consistency:
Information in MT 700 must not be repeated or conflict with that in any related MT 701.
 Clarity and precision:
Advising banks must ensure the documentary credit is advised clearly and unambiguously to the beneficiary.
 Potential issues with MT 700 usage
Complexity and errors:
The detailed and structured nature of MT 700 messages, while beneficial for clarity, can lead to complexity in filling out the forms accurately.  Errors in these messages can cause delays in transactions, misunderstandings, or financial losses.
 Fraud risk:
Despite the secure nature of SWIFT messaging, the system is not immune to fraud.  Parties may present fraudulent documents or misuse the MT 700, necessitating robust verification processes.
 Interoperability challenges:
As global trade involves multiple parties across different jurisdictions, the varying levels of technological adoption can lead to interoperability issues, where not all banks or financial institutions can efficiently process or verify MT 700 messages.

Advancements in MT 700 usage
Blockchain and smart contracts:
Innovations such as blockchain technology and smart contracts are being explored to complement or potentially replace traditional methods like the MT 700.  These technologies promise enhanced security, reduced risk of fraud, and increased efficiency by automating the verification process and ensuring compliance with the terms of the documentary credit.
 Digitalisation of trade finance:
The digitalisation wave within trade finance is leading to more streamlined processes, where electronic versions of trade documents, including electronic Letters of Credit (eLCs), are becoming more accepted.  This digital shift could mitigate some of the issues related to manual data entry and paper-based documentation.
 Integration with trade platforms:
The integration of MT 700 messaging within broader digital trade platforms and ecosystems offers improved efficiency, better tracking of transactions, and enhanced collaboration among all parties involved in international trade. 
These platforms can provide real-time updates and facilitate quicker resolutions to discrepancies or issues.
 The landscape of international trade finance is evolving rapidly, with technological advancements aimed at addressing the inherent challenges of traditional instruments like the MT 700.
 The MT 700 plays a pivotal role in documentary credit transactions, facilitating clear communication of terms and conditions between the issuing and advising banks.  Understanding its structure, rules and specifications is essential for professionals in international trade finance to ensure smooth and efficient transactions.
 While there are potential issues related to complexity, fraud, and interoperability, ongoing innovations in digitalisation, blockchain, and integrated trade platforms are paving the way for a more efficient, secure, and transparent future in trade finance.

The MT 707 plays a crucial role in the fluid dynamics of international trade finance, serving as a communication tool for amending the terms and conditions of a documentary credit. 
This guide aims to unpack the MT 707 format, shedding light on its users, purposes, potential challenges, and the advancements shaping its future use.
 The MT 707 message, utilised for amending a documentary credit, comprises various fields that facilitate precise modifications to the credit’s terms.  Here’s a closer examination of its format specifications and some key fields:
MT 707 format specifications
Scope: The MT 707 allows issuing banks to communicate amendments to advising banks, which can further relay these changes to other relevant parties.  It is instrumental in updating the terms and conditions initially set forth by the documentary credit.
 Functionality: This message type ensures that any changes, whether adding, modifying, or deleting terms, are clearly communicated and acknowledged by all involved parties.
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
Key fields explained
27 – Sequence of Total & 20 – Sender’s Reference & 21 – Receiver’s Reference:
These fields ensure the amendment’s proper sequencing and provide unique identifiers for both the sender and receiver, facilitating accurate tracking and referencing of the amendment.

31C – Date of Issue & 26E – Number of Amendment & 30 – Date of Amendment:
Outline the original issuance date of the credit, the specific amendment sequence, and the date on which the amendment is made, crucial for historical tracking and validity of the changes.
 22A – Purpose of Message & 32B/33B – Increase/Decrease of Documentary Credit Amount:
Identify the amendment’s intent and detail any adjustments in the credit amount, ensuring clear communication of the amendment’s nature and financial impact.
 59 – Beneficiary:
Any changes to the beneficiary’s details are specified here, ensuring accurate identification.
 Network Validated Rules
C1:
At least one field must be present after field 22A to validate the amendment’s content, ensuring that the amendment’s details are properly conveyed.
 C2 & C3:
Specify that either an increase or decrease in the documentary credit amount can be stated (but not both simultaneously) and that either field 50B (Non-Bank Issuer) or field 52a (Issuing Bank) must be present, enhancing clarity on the issuing entity and the amendment’s financial aspects.

C4:
Dictates the exclusive presence of either the latest date of shipment (44C) or shipment period (44D), avoiding conflicting information on shipment timelines.
 Usage rules
Comprehensive amendments:
When details exceed the MT 707’s capacity, additional information must be transmitted via MT 708 messages, allowing for an exhaustive presentation of changes.
 Operative nature:
The MT 707, along with any associated MT 708s, forms an integral part of the documentary credit, affirming the amendments as part of the binding terms unless specified otherwise.
 Consistency and clarity:
Amendments must be precisely defined to avoid repetition and ensure no conflicting information is presented across related messages.
 Who uses MT 707 and why?
 The users of MT707
Banks and financial institutions across the globe employ the MT 707 for amending documentary credits in international trade.  The issuing bank initiates amendments, which are then communicated to advising or transferring banks.  This message type is pivotal for importers, exporters, and their financiers, ensuring that documentary credits accurately reflect the terms agreed upon by all parties involved.
 Reasons for using MT707
The primary function of an MT 707 is to adjust a documentary credit’s terms to align with changes in trade agreements or to correct errors.  This flexibility is vital for adapting to evolving trade conditions, facilitating smooth transaction flows, and maintaining the integrity of trade financing operations.  It allows parties to promptly address and implement necessary adjustments without needing to issue a new documentary credit.
 Potential issues and advancements
Challenges with MT 707
Complexity and compliance:
Amendments require meticulous attention to detail to ensure compliance with international trade laws and regulations, adding complexity to trade finance operations.

Operational risks:
Incorrectly executed amendments can lead to disputes, delays, and financial losses, emphasising the need for accuracy and clarity.
 Adaptation to changes:
Rapidly changing trade environments and regulations demand agility and responsiveness from all parties, posing challenges in maintaining up-to-date amendments.
 Advancements impacting MT 707
Digitalisation and automation:
The adoption of digital platforms and automation technologies promises to streamline the amendment process, reducing the potential for errors and enhancing efficiency.
 Blockchain technology:
Blockchain offers a secure and transparent framework for executing amendments, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation while potentially reducing fraud risks.
 Integration with electronic documentation:
The move towards electronic documentation in trade finance can simplify the amendment process, allowing for quicker adjustments and better traceability.
 The structure of the MT 707 message is meticulously designed to cater to the dynamic needs of international trade finance, facilitating smooth and clear communication of amendments to documentary credits. 
Through its comprehensive format and strict validation rules, the MT 707 ensures that all parties remain informed and aligned on the terms of trade transactions.
 The MT 707 is indispensable in international trade finance, enabling parties to adapt documentary credits to changing circumstances efficiently.  While challenges exist, technological advancements are paving the way for more streamlined, secure, and effective amendment processes, promising to enhance the agility and resilience of global trade operations.

Understanding MT 710: advice of a third bank’s or a non-bank’s documentary credit
The MT 710 message, integral to the Swift network, is key in international trade finance. 
It facilitates the advising of documentary credits across banking institutions and non-bank entities.
 MT 710 format specifications
Intended to advise banks about the terms and conditions of a documentary credit issued by another bank or a non-bank entity, the MT 710 allows communication between the issuing and advising banks, directly impacting the execution of international trade agreements.
 MT 710 key fields:
The MT 710 has several key fields, including:
Fields 21 (Documentary Credit Number) and 31C (Date of Issue):
These fields identify the credit and mark its issuance date, which is needed for tracking and compliance.
 Field 23 (Reference to Pre-Advice):
This field should be mentioned to underline the importance of pre-advisory communication in the MT 710 message.
 Fields 27 (Sequence of Total) and 20 (Sender’s Reference):
This field provides sequencing and a unique identifier for the documentary credit to ensure traceability.
 Fields 32B (Currency Code, Amount) and 49 (Confirmation Instructions):
These fields specify the financial aspects and confirmation requirements for risk management and transaction validity.

Fields 40E
(
Applicable Rules) and 31D (Date and Place of Expiry:
These fields detail the governing rules and the credit’s expiry details, which are vital for legal and operational clarity.
 Fields 50 (Applicant) and 59 (Beneficiary):
These fields identify the parties initiating and benefiting from the credit and are central to the transaction’s execution.
 Field 78D (Instructions from Intermediary Bank)
: This newly mentioned field provides specific instructions from intermediary banks involved in the transaction.
 Importance of MT 710
The MT 710 is pivotal for international trade finance as it:
Facilitates secure communication:
The MT 710 provides a standardised, secure method for banks to communicate the terms and conditions of a documentary credit issued by another bank or non-bank entity.  This secure communication channel minimises the risk of fraud and misunderstanding in international trade transactions.
 Enhances operational efficiency:
By clearly advising on the details of documentary credits, the MT 710 streamlines international trade, enabling faster, more efficient transaction execution. 
This efficiency is particularly important in a global trade environment where timing and accuracy are important.
 Supports compliance and risk management:
The standardised format of the MT 710 helps ensure that all parties know and can comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.  This compliance helps manage the risks associated with international trade, such as non-performance by a counterparty or non-compliance with international trade regulations.
 Enables trust and reliability:
For beneficiaries, the MT 710 assures that a documentary credit, backed by a bank or a non-bank entity, is in place to secure their transaction.  This assurance builds trust between trading partners who may not have a direct relationship or operate across legal jurisdictions.
 Promotes international trade growth:
The MT 710 contributes to international trade growth by facilitating smoother and more reliable trade transactions.  It allows businesses to expand their operations into new markets confidently, knowing that there is a standardised mechanism for managing the financial aspects of their trade agreements.

Who uses MT 710 and why?

Users
Financial institutions and non-bank entities issuing documentary credits use the MT 710 to communicate these credits’ specifics to banks advising the beneficiaries.  This broad user base includes international traders, banks, and corporates engaged in cross-border transactions, requiring precise and reliable documentary credit advisories.
 Purpose
The MT 710 is crucial for ensuring that beneficiaries are accurately informed about the documentary credits in their favour.
 It formalises the notification process, facilitating trust and adherence to international trade agreements.  By providing a standardised method for advising credits, the MT 710 supports the execution and fulfilment of contractual obligations in international trade, enhancing transactional efficiency and reliability.
 Potential issues and advancements
Challenges
Complexity and expertise
: The intricate nature of documentary credits and the detailed requirements of the MT 710 message require specialised knowledge, making it complex to manage.

Interoperability concerns
: Differences in technology and standards across banks can challenge the seamless processing of MT 710 messages.
 Advancements
Digitalisation efforts
: The move towards digital trade finance platforms is streamlining the advisory process, reducing potential errors, and increasing operational efficiency.
 Blockchain and smart contracts
.  These can automate advisory processes, ensure transaction security, and enhance transparency in international trade finance.
 The MT 710 message type is fundamental to trade finance.  It enables clear and efficient communication of documentary credits among international trade participants.  Amidst evolving global trade dynamics, the MT 710, supplemented by ongoing technological innovations, remains central to facilitating robust and transparent trade financing operations.
 The MT 710 plays a critical role in international trade finance by providing a secure, efficient, and reliable means of advising documentary credits.  Its importance extends beyond mere transactional communication; it underpins the trust, compliance, and risk management framework that global trade relies upon.

Understanding MT 720: transfer of a documentary credit
The MT 720 message is crucial in international trade finance. 
It is designed for when a beneficiary requests a documentary credit to be transferred to a second beneficiary.  This SWIFT message is dispatched by the bank authorised to manage the transfer and directed towards the bank advising the second beneficiary.
 It outlines the terms and conditions of the transferred documentary credit, in full or part, ensuring that all involved parties understand the credit terms underpinning their transactions.
 MT 720 format specifications
The MT 720 is used when a beneficiary requests the transfer of a documentary credit to a second beneficiary.  The bank authorised to advise the transfer sends this message, ensuring that all parties involved are informed of the terms and conditions of the transferred credit.
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
MT 720 key fields:
The MT 720 message has several key fields, including:
Fields 27 (Sequence of Total) and 20 (Transferring Bank’s Reference):
These fields provide a framework for sequencing and identifying the transfer process, establishing a clear audit trail.

Fields 31C (Date of Issue) and 31D (Date and Place of Expiry):
These fields define the operational timeline of the credit, specifying its validity period and timing.
 Fields 50 (First Beneficiary) and 59 (Second Beneficiary):
These fields identify the original and the new beneficiaries.  This is crucial for acknowledging the transfer’s intent and confirming the parties’ rights and obligations under the new credit terms.
 Field 32B (Currency Code, Amount):
This field specifies the amount and currency being transferred.
 Fields 41a, 42C, 42a, and more:
Additional fields detailing instructions from the transferring bank (78D) and specifications on handling partial shipments and deferred payment details (42P, 43P) provide further information to the corresponding parties.
 Network-validated rules and usage
The MT 720 message adheres to network-validated rules designed to ensure clarity, prevent errors, and facilitate the smooth processing of documentary credit transfers.  These include:
Fields presence and combination:
Specific fields, such as 42C and 42a, must be present for a valid message.  Furthermore, the message must accommodate the fields 42C and 42a together, field 42M alone, or field 42P alone, preventing any other combinations to avoid ambiguities.
 Operational instrument status:
Unless specified otherwise, the MT 720 message, along with any supplementary MT 721 messages, constitutes an operative credit instrument. 
This underscores the message’s legal and procedural weight in the documentary credit transfer process.
 Consistency and non-repetition:
Information conveyed must be consistent across related messages, with no repetition in any related MT 721 messages.  This ensures that the transfer is precisely documented, upholding the integrity of the transaction.
 Why is MT 720 an important messaging term for global trade transactions?
 The MT 720 is important for global transactions as it:
Enables flexibility in trade transactions:
The MT 720 allows the original beneficiary of a documentary credit to transfer all or part of the credit to a second beneficiary.  This flexibility is crucial in trade transactions involving intermediaries or when goods are sourced from third parties.
 Ensures accurate communication of terms:
By providing a structured format for advising the transfer of a documentary credit, the MT 720 ensures that the terms and conditions of the original credit are accurately communicated to the second beneficiary. 
This accuracy is vital for maintaining trust and clarity between the parties.
 Facilitates risk management:
Extending the security and assurance provided by a documentary credit to secondary parties supports the financial stability of the trade transaction, ensuring that suppliers and subcontractors are also protected under the terms of the original credit.
 Promotes efficiency in trade finance:
The standardised format of the MT 720 message streamlines the process of transferring documentary credits.  This standardisation reduces potential errors and misunderstandings, leading to faster processing and more efficient transaction handling.
 Supports smaller businesses:
The MT 720 helps smaller businesses in international trade by enabling the transfer of documentary credits to second beneficiaries.  This inclusivity promotes the growth and diversification of the global economy, allowing smaller entities to engage in transactions that might otherwise be beyond their reach.
 Who uses MT 720 and why?
 Users
Banks and financial institutions that handle documentary credits use MT 720 to facilitate the transfer of these credits at the request of the first beneficiary.  This process is crucial for businesses engaged in international trade, especially when intermediaries or agents are involved in transactions.
 Purpose
The MT 720 is essential for ensuring the terms and conditions of the transferred documentary credit are clearly communicated to the second beneficiary.  This clarity is crucial for the smooth execution of trade transactions.  It enables the second beneficiary to understand and comply with the terms of the credit, thereby facilitating global trade by extending the credit’s benefits to further parties in the supply chain.
 Potential issues and advancements
Challenges
Complexity of transfer
:
Transferring a documentary credit can be complex, requiring meticulous attention to detail to ensure accuracy and compliance with international trade laws.
 Operational risks
:
Errors in the transfer process can lead to disputes, delays, and potential financial losses, highlighting the need for precision and expertise.

Advancements
Digitalisation and blockchain
:
Efforts to digitalise trade finance processes and the introduction of blockchain technology promise to streamline the transfer of documentary credits, reduce errors, enhance security, and improve efficiency.
 Electronic documentary credits
: The adoption of electronic documentary credits (eUCP) facilitates easier and faster transfers, enabling better tracking and management of credits throughout the trade process.
 The MT 720 is a cornerstone in the architecture of international trade finance, providing a structured and secure method for transferring documentary credits.
 It provides flexibility, accuracy, risk management, efficiency, and support for smaller businesses in international trade finance.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Understanding MT 734: advice of refusal
The Swift message type (MT) 734, “Advice of Refusal”, helps maintain the integrity of international transactions involving documentary credits.

Issuing and nominated banks use this message to communicate with the presenting bank, detailing the refusal of documents that do not comply with the terms and conditions of a documentary credit.
 The MT 734 is vital for risk management, dispute resolution, and compliance adherence.
 MT 734 format specifications
The MT 734 is designed to communicate a refusal of documents that, on their face, do not comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.
 It also provides instructions for disposing of these documents and can be used to claim refunds.
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
MT 734 key fields:
The MT 734 message has several key fields that ensure precise communication of the reasons for document refusal and subsequent actions required.  These fields include:
Fields 20 (Sender’s Transaction Reference) and 21 (Presenting Bank’s Reference):
These fields offer a unique identifier for the transaction and link the refusal to the specific presentation by the presenting bank.  Together, they are essential for tracking and establishing a clear reference point for the document presentation.

Field 32A (Date and Amount of Utilisation):
This field indicates the date when and the amount of the credit used.  Understanding when and how much of the credit was drawn upon during the document presentation helps all parties gauge the transaction’s scope and the refusal’s implications.
 Field 77J (Discrepancies):
Perhaps the most critical component of the MT 734, this field details the reasons for the document refusal.  By clearly stating the discrepancies as they appear on the face of the documents, this field facilitates targeted communication between banks, enabling the presenting bank to address and potentially rectify the identified issues.
 Field 77B (Disposal of Documents):
This field instructs the presenting bank on proceeding with the documents and whether they should be returned, held pending further instructions, or otherwise disposed of.
 Why is the MT 734 important in international trade?
 The MT 734 is important for global transactions as it:
Ensures integrity of trade transactions:
The MT 734 maintains strict adherence to the terms and conditions outlined in documentary credits by facilitating the formal notification of document refusal due to discrepancies.
 Promotes efficient dispute resolution:
The detailed advice of refusal, including specific discrepancies and instructions for document disposal, allows for a more structured and efficient approach to resolving disputes between parties involved in the trade.
 Supports compliance and risk management:
The MT 734 helps mitigate risks associated with documentary credit transactions by clearly communicating non-compliance and facilitating the appropriate handling of refused documents.
 Facilitates transparent communication:
The structured format of the MT 734 ensures that all parties involved in a transaction are fully aware of any issues with documents presented under a documentary credit, promoting transparency and accountability.

Who uses MT 734, and why?

Users
Issuing and nominated banks are the primary users of MT 734 in the context of documentary credits.
 These entities use the message to formally notify the presenting bank of the refusal of documents due to non-compliance with the credit terms and conditions.
 Purpose
The MT 734 ensures that discrepancies are communicated and addressed, upholding the standards required for international trade financing.
 The message also facilitates the orderly resolution of disputes and the proper handling of refused documents.
 Potential issues and technological advancements
Challenges
The complexity of discrepancy identification:
Identifying and detailing discrepancies in trade documents can be complex and requires a high level of expertise, making the process susceptible to errors and misunderstandings.
 Operational delays:
The refusal of documents can lead to delays in the transaction, affecting the timely completion of trade operations and potentially leading to financial losses for the parties involved.

Advancements
Digitalisation and automation:
Advances in digital document handling and automation technologies are streamlining the discrepancy identification process, reducing errors, and speeding up the communication of refusals.
 Blockchain and smart contracts:
Integrating blockchain technology and smart contracts in trade finance can enhance transparency, security, and efficiency.  These technologies could potentially automate compliance checks, minimising the likelihood of document refusal.
 The MT 734 is a vital instrument in international trade finance that provides a structured mechanism for advising the refusal of documents under documentary credits.
 Its importance lies in its ability to facilitate clear communication, ensure compliance with trade terms, and efficiently resolve discrepancies.
 As the trade finance landscape evolves, technological advancements promise to further enhance the functionality and effectiveness of the MT 734 and similar message types.

Understanding MT 742: Reimbursement claim in international trade finance
International trade finance is the unseen engine that powers global commerce, ensuring transactions across borders are not just possible but streamlined and secure. 
Central to this system is SWIFT messaging.
 The MT 742, also known as the Reimbursement Claim, is critical in the ecosystem.
 This article examines the MT 742, drawing from official SWIFT documentation to highlight its functionality, significance, and broader impact on global trade finance.
 Overview of MT 742
MT 742 is a cornerstone in international trade finance, facilitating critical communication between banks for the reimbursement of payments or negotiations under documentary credits.  These agreements guarantee payment for goods or services on behalf of the buyer, ensuring transactions are secure, and parties are protected.
 When a bank pays or negotiates under these credits, sending an MT 742 message requests reimbursement from the authorised bank.  This recovers funds used to honour the commitments.
 Using MT 742 is essential for documentary credits and standby letters of credit, where it acts as a safety net for transactions.  However, MT 742 is specifically designed for these financial instruments and does not apply to guarantees, which are separate commitments to pay.

Purpose of the reimbursement claim
The main purpose of MT 742 is to simplify the process of claiming reimbursements in trade finance.  When a bank makes payments on behalf of a client or accepts bills under the terms of a documentary credit – a formal agreement to pay the exporter for goods or services – it seeks reimbursement from the designated bank to cover the cost.
 This reimbursement balances the financial records between the banks involved and guarantees an accurate money return per the trade agreement’s conditions.
 Key users of MT 742
Paying and negotiating banks:
These institutions are the primary users of MT 742.  They make payments or negotiate terms under documentary credits and subsequently seek reimbursement for these expenditures.
 Reimbursing banks:
These banks receive MT 742 messages and are responsible for reimbursing the initial paying or negotiating bank according to the terms specified in the documentary credit or other related trade finance instruments.  Their role compliments the financial loop and ensures the proper allocation of funds back to the initial payment party.

Explanation of key fields
An MT 742 message has several key fields to ensure the claim process is transparent and accurate.  These include:
Field 20 (Claiming Bank’s Reference) and Field 21 (Documentary Credit Number):
These fields provide a unique identifier for the claim and reference the specific documentary credit involved, making the claim easily traceable.  For example, the claiming bank’s reference might be a unique code that the bank uses internally, while the documentary credit number directly relates to the specific transaction documentation.
 Field 31C (Date of Issue):
This field records the issuance date of the original documentary credit, placing the claim in a specific time frame and ensuring it aligns with the credit’s terms.
 Field 52a (Issuing Bank):
This identifies the bank that issued the documentary credit.  Knowing which bank initiated the credit is crucial for the reimbursement process, as it establishes the transaction’s origin.
 Fields 32B (Principal Amount Claimed) and 33B (Additional Amount Claimed):
These fields specify the principal amount being claimed alongside any additional amounts. 
They provide a clear view of the financial dimensions involved in the reimbursement, highlighting the total sum the claiming bank seeks to recover.
 Fields 71D (Charges) and 34a (Total Amount Claimed):
These outline any charges associated with the claim and the total amount being reclaimed.  Comprehensive documentation of all financial aspects of the claim is essential, including any fees or charges incurred.
 The significance of MT 742 in trade finance
MT 742 maintains the smoothness and integrity of trade finance operations, as it plays a significant role in:
Risk management:
By facilitating the process for banks to reclaim funds allocated for documentary credits, MT 742 plays a vital role in enhancing the sector’s risk management capabilities.  This functionality is crucial for financial stability, allowing banks to mitigate potential financial losses efficiently.
 Dispute resolution:
MT 742 is a preventive measure against potential disputes.  Providing a structured and transparent framework for reimbursement claims ensures all involved parties have a clear understanding of transaction terms. 
This clarity is key to resolving disagreements and maintaining harmonious operations.
 Compliance:
Adherence to the standardised format of MT 742 is essential for banks to comply with international trade finance regulations.  This standardisation ensures that transactions meet and uphold global standards.
 Impact on international trade
The MT 742 message is pivotal in international trade finance, significantly affecting all stakeholders, from issuing banks to beneficiaries.
 MT 742 specifically tackles operational risks – such as payment delays or documentation discrepancies – and the complexities of regulatory compliance across different jurisdictions.  Its structured communication format aids procedural adherence and is crucial for mitigating financial risks.
 Moreover, MT 742 simplifies the regulatory compliance process by facilitating adherence to diverse global standards.  This bolsters security and effectiveness, making trade finance operations secure and efficient globally.
 The future of technology in trade finance
The digitalisation of financial services and the integration of blockchain technology are transforming trade finance. 
These innovations may revolutionise traditional practices, such as the processing and managing of MT 742 messages.
 Digital technologies promise to enhance security, reduce fraud risk, and increase efficiency through automation, making the reimbursement claiming processes in trade finance more streamlined and reliable.
 Specifically, blockchain technology could revolutionise the verification and settlement processes by providing immutable transaction records, reducing the time and cost of cross-border payments.  However, adopting these technologies also presents challenges, including regulatory compliance, data privacy, and the need for standardisation across the industry.
 As the trade finance sector evolves, it has never been more imperative for finance professionals to remain well-versed in Swift standards and proactive in leveraging technological innovations.  This transition demands a robust understanding of existing frameworks and an anticipatory grasp of emerging technologies.
 Looking ahead, the finance community’s collective efforts in embracing change and driving innovation will be key to ensuring the continued strength and adaptability of the global trade finance ecosystem.

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Unpacking MT 759: The ancillary trade structured message in international trade finance
Swift message type (MT) 759, known as the Ancillary Trade Structured Message, stands out for its versatility. 
It addresses various informational needs crucial for trade transactions, from issuing fraud alerts to exchanging financial information.
 MT 759 bridges communication gaps, and is key for trade finance.
 Overview of MT 759
MT 759 supports sharing and requesting crucial details for trade transactions.  These include various documents, such as credits, demand guarantees, standby letters of credit, and other commitments like guarantees and sureties.
 Its scope is broad, addressing numerous needs – from alerting parties about potential fraud to facilitating requests for additional financing.  This ensures that all stakeholders remain informed and ready to respond to any changes in their trade agreements.
 MT 759’s targeted approach to trade transactions sets it apart from other MT messages.  This focus significantly improves the clarity and efficiency of communication.
 MT 759 core users and their goals
Banks and financial institutions that manage trade finance operations use MT 759.
 It is particularly useful for communicating additional details or special requests not typically accommodated by standard documentary credits or guarantee messages.

MT 759 has various applications, including:
Fraud alerts:
Enables institutions to communicate concerns about potential fraud within a specific transaction quickly.
 Financing requests:
Facilitates submitting requests for additional financing or modifications to existing financial arrangements.
 General information:
Helps with exchanging information affecting a trade transaction’s terms, implementation, or conditions.
 Overview of key components
MT 759 has several key fields:
Field 20 (Transaction Reference Number):
This field assigns a unique identifier to each transaction and ensures clear tracking and reference.
 Fields 22D (Form of Undertaking) and 23H (Function of Message):
These fields detail the commitment’s nature and the message’s primary purpose, ranging from issuance requests to fraud alerts.  They play a crucial role in specifying the message’s intent.
 Field 45D (Narrative):
This field provides ample space for narrative descriptions, allowing for the inclusion of detailed information or instructions related to the trade transaction.

Impact of MT 759 on trade finance
MT 759 ensures the smooth and secure operation of trade finance activities.  It stands at the forefront of risk management strategies by enabling the efficient management of trade transactions through the rapid exchange of information.  This allows all parties involved to quickly address discrepancies, potential fraud, or changes in transaction terms.
 Furthermore, MT 759 aids compliance efforts and dispute resolution.  Its structured format for presenting detailed, transaction-related information enhances transparency and promotes accountability.
 Effects on international trade
Adopting MT 759 significantly benefits stakeholders across the trade finance sector, enabling communication of secondary issues.  It skillfully manages challenges such as fraud detection and the need for transaction changes.  Furthermore, MT 759 serves as a reliable channel for requesting additional financing or for clarifications on transaction terms.
 This capability enhances the operational resilience and adaptability of international trade operations. 
MT 759 simplifies the process of navigating the complexities of global commerce, thereby enhancing the ease and efficiency of operations.
 The future of technology in trade finance
The rise of digitalisation and blockchain technology opens possibilities for enhancing MT 759.  These technologies have the potential to transform the communication of ancillary trade information, introduce more automated processes, and strengthen security measures.
 As the trade finance sector evolves, there is an expectation for MT 759 to become increasingly integrated with electronic documentation and smart contracts.  This integration signifies a substantial move towards a more agile and secure management of trade transactions, perfectly aligning with the fast-paced demands of global commerce.
 Embracing these advancements requires continuous adaptation and innovation.  This ensures that the full benefits of emerging technologies are realised within the trade finance landscape, keeping pace with the evolving needs of businesses worldwide.

MT 760 belongs to a category of SWIFT Message types for guaranteeing letters of credit. 
SWIFT stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.  Essentially, it is used to securely transfer information and instructions through a system of codes.
 What is a SWIFT Code?
 It works because SWIFT allocates each organization a specific code that is called the Bank Identifier Code (BIC)/ SWIFT Code.
 If your business works with
Bank Guarantees
,
Documentary Credits
or
Letters of Credit (LCs)
, the term ‘MT 760’ may have been used.
 MT760 inter-bank Deal
Who Needs SWIFT?
 Originally, the founders of SWIFT aimed the network at Treasury communications, however, its popularity grew and with this growth, came SWIFT’s customer base.  The message’s format allowed for great expansion and allowed SWIFT to now provide to:
Banks
Exchanges
Asset Management Companies
Brokerages/ Trading companies
Normal Businesses
Treasury market
Example of the format of an MT 76
An example of an MT 760 message could include the following:
A narrative statement explaining the context (e.g.  XX company has signed a contract with YY company to provide equipment.
 Narrative would state all of the details of the transaction (as per the formats above).
 The SWIFT message would include the Sender, Message Type (760), Receiver and Sequence number, before providing information required.

Figure 1: An example of a MT760 (Source:
SWIFT
)
What happened before Swift?

Before SWIFT was used to guarantee Letters of Credit and send information, a system called
Telex
was used.  This was unfortunately hindered by low speeds, multiple security concerns and also no coding system – Transactions had to be described by the senders which were then interpreted by the receiver.
 Why is MT 760 used in trade?
 MT 760 can be used either by the party issuing a beneficiary on a guarantee or LOC, or by the party issuing a counter-undertaking to the beneficiary.
 MT 760 is another type of SWIFT message sent from an issuing bank to an advising bank, with details of the SBLC or bank guarantee.  Generally, the MT 799 is subject to the rules of the following:
URDG (Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees)
ICC UCP 600 (International Chamber of Commerce Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credit)
ISP (International Standby Practices)
What are the rules of the MT 760?
 Often MT 760s reach their maximum size limit, so one or more can be used to extend the size.  Additional MT 760s require MT 761s, and up to eight can be sent on top of the original MT 760 to provide the relevant information on the SBLC or Guarantee.
 It’s important to ensure that duplicate content is not added to supplementary MT 761s (e.g.  the Undertaking Amount), and that the information does not conflict with the MT 760.

Sequence C (Optional Information) can only be used when Sequence B is for a counter-undertaking for a Guarantee or Letter of Credit.
 MT 760 Criteria
Unlike the MT 799, the 760
requires much more information regarding the transaction.  Information such as:
Parties involved (Issuer, Beneficiary, Applicant, Obligor, Advising Bank)
Transaction Details
Transport details; goods presentation
Dates and timings
Potential Issues/ Advancements for SWIFT
In late 2017, SWIFT worked on a proof-of-concept with six major banks which was aiming to discover whether Blockchain technology can help them reconcile their NOSTRO accounts in real time.
 A NOSTRO account is a bank account that a UK Bank has with a foreign Bank, and it usually is in the currency of that country.   The way in which Blockchain constantly updates the logbook owned by every member of the chain provides transparency which SWIFT may look to utilize to increase efficiency in the messaging process.
 This is an issue SWIFT has.  As many of their clients have astronomical transaction volumes, they are difficult to keep up with.  Although their capability is far better than Telex, the need for automation in the creation and processing of messages is no secret.

Navigating MT 765: The role of guarantee/standby letter of credit demand in global trade
Swift message type (MT) 765 helps ensure efficient and secure interbank communication in trade finance.

This protocol, which focuses on guarantee and standby letter of credit demands, enables stakeholders to demand payment confidently under specific financial instruments.
 To understand MT 765, it is important to examine its operational specifics and evolution in the world of trade finance technology.
 Overview of MT 765
MT 765 enables the request for payment under guarantees or standby letters of credit.
 It is a direct line of communication from the beneficiary (or their representative) to the guarantee issuer.  This role helps activate the financial commitments outlined in trade finance instruments, such as documentary credits and standby letters of credit.
 MT 765 enhances the security and reliability of international trade transactions by enabling beneficiaries to use these financial tools effectively once the payment conditions are satisfied.

SWIFT
Important key fields
MT 765 has several key fields, including:
Field 20 (Transaction Reference Number):
This field provides a unique identifier for each demand, enabling precise tracking and reference.

Fields 32B (Demand Amount) and 22G (Demand Type):
These fields specify the amount being demanded and the nature of the demand, which are critical for ensuring the clarity and validity of the payment request.
 Fields 52A (Issuer) and 59A (Beneficiary):
Identify the parties involved, ensuring that demands are accurately directed and attributed.
 Field 31L (Date of Demand):
Marks the formal request’s timing, crucial for adherence to the terms under which the guarantee or standby letter of credit was issued.
 Users and purpose
MT 765 primarily serves beneficiaries of guarantees or standby letters of credit.  This includes companies and financial institutions engaged in international trade.
 Its core purpose is to enforce financial commitments through official payment requests, vital for managing risks, resolving disputes, and ensuring compliance with regulations.
 Role of MT 765 in trade finance
MT 765 ensures the smooth operation of trade finance transactions as it helps with risk management and dispute resolution.

By enforcing contractual commitments within trade instruments, MT 765 introduces a standardised approach for invoking guarantees or standby letters of credit.  This standardisation is key to building trust and promoting efficiency across international trade channels.
 Impact on international trade
MT 765 introduces a formalised process for payment requests, ensuring that financial guarantees fulfil their role as reliable instruments in trade.
 This capability of MT 765 addresses the challenges of payment risks and disputes, enhancing the predictability and reliability of trade finance.
 Consequently, MT 765 has become an indispensable asset within the global trading ecosystem.
 Technological advances and what lies ahead
Digitalisation and blockchain technology have the potential to revolutionise the use of MT 765.  These technologies aim to streamline the demand process, reduce errors, and enhance transaction security.
 Experts anticipate that the years ahead will see a deeper integration of MT 765 with digital trade platforms.

This evolution prepares MT 765 to navigate new challenges and capitalise on opportunities presented by technological advancements.
 As the trade finance sector evolves, influenced by globalisation and technological advances, the importance of understanding and applying MT 765 remains essential for confidently navigating the future complexities of international trade.

Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.

Deep dive into MT 767: Amendment to a demand guarantee/standby letter of credit
Swift message type (MT) 767 has an important role in trade finance. 
It simplifies the amendment of demand guarantees or standby letters of credit (SBLCs), allowing global trade transactions to operate smoothly.
 To understand MT 767 fully, it is important to examine its structure, present capabilities, and expected enhancements.
 Overview of MT 767
The MT 767 communicates amendments to financial agreements such as demand guarantees or standby letters of credit.
 Issuers or advisors use this message to directly inform beneficiaries about changes.  This is crucial, especially when the beneficiary is a financial institution or when there’s a designated party responsible for advising the beneficiary on these amendments.
 The MT 767 message can communicate a broad range of modifications, including adjustments to the amount guaranteed, changes to expiry dates, and more detailed revisions to the terms and conditions.
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
Explanation of key fields
MT 767 has several key fields, including:
Fields 20 (Undertaking Number) and 26E (Number of Amendment):
These fields play critical roles in tracking and identifying the specific agreement and its sequence of amendments.

Field 30 (Date of Amendment):
This field captures the official date on which changes were implemented
Field 52a (Issuer):
This field identifies the authority issuing the amendment.
 Fields 32B (Increase of Undertaking Amount) and 33B (Decrease of Undertaking Amount):
These fields address adjustments to the amount, clarify whether there is an increase or decrease, and provide detailed information on financial changes.
 Field 77U (Other Amendments to Undertaking):
This field allows additional modifications to the agreement not specified in other fields, offering flexibility to cover a wide array of amendment types.
 Users and purpose
Banks, financial institutions, and corporations engaged in international trade use MT 767 extensively as it enables the flexible adjustment of guarantees or standby letters of credit.
 This adaptability ensures these financial instruments continue to be relevant and effective.
 Importance in trade finance
The MT 767 represents the flexibility and adaptability that are crucial for international trade finance.

By enabling amendments to the terms of guarantees or standby letters of credit, the MT 767 is instrumental in risk management, dispute resolution, and ensuring compliance with international trade agreements.
 Technological advancements and future outlook
Digital technologies and blockchain integration have the potential to revolutionise the processing of MT 767 messages, promising enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency.
 These technological advancements are expected to streamline the amendment process, reduce errors, and foster a more robust trade finance ecosystem.
 Such evolution points towards a future where amendments to guarantees or standby letters of credit are executed with greater speed and reliability.  This development will facilitate a more agile and responsive framework for international trade finance.

MT 798 is a multi-bank messaging type which is used for international trade – import, export and standby Letters of Credit.
 If you deal with international trade financing through instruments like
Bank Guarantees
,
Documentary Credits
, and
Letters of Credit (LCs)
, you may have heard of FIN MT 7nn, which is a category 7 SWIFT code which supports the processing of bank guarantees and documentary credits between banks around the world.

In trade finance, there are several bank-to-bank and corporate-to-bank messaging systems which allow for the flow of information relating to trade finance transactions.  MT 700 or MT 7nn, MT 760 and MT 798 are the three most prolific messaging types for documentary credits, standby Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees.  The following workflow shows a typical messaging service between an applicant and an advising bank, and also the reverse, between a beneficiary and the issuing banks, and where MT 7nn fits in.
 Lead Bank Model – Applicant Side
Lead Bank Model – Beneficiary Side

SWIFT
What is the format of the MT 798?
 Depending on the type of transaction (e.g.  applying for a documentary credit, issuing an SBLC, or perhaps refusing a Letter of Credit), the format differs, and the sub-messages which are incorporated into the MT 798 will be different.
 Here’s an example of an application for documentary credit transaction, which includes the index message (essentially the contents of the MT 798), the details messaging and an optional extension message which can incorporate other messaging types.

SWIFT
What is the format of MT 798?
 Within the MT 798 messaging, there are several sub-messages which can be incorporated into the message.  We’ve put a Document together on the format of MT 798 which you can view here:
MT 798 Format Types
Download
What information is required by the financial institution?
 A funder will need to know the name of the advising bank.  However, they will request more granular detail, such as the LC Number and LC Amount.  This will also include the tenor or length of the draft.  This will be alongside the latest date of shipment.  The company that is liable for the confirmation fee needs to be known; along with information on what the products are being traded, location, port, unloading location and whether the LC is restricted for negotiation or not.
 Some of the information for an MT 798, required by a financial institution include:
Unique Transaction Number
Sub-Message Type
Method of Issue – (How the Documentary Credit is Issued, e.g., courier and post type)
Bank Details
Charges Payable to the Bank
Who pays the confirmation charges
Transport Mode (e.g.  Air, Sea, Rail, Road, Multinodal)
Forward Contract Reference Numbers
File Identification Number
Bank Details

Soft Commodities Trader
Due to increased sales, a soft commodity trader required a receivables purchase facility for one of their large customers - purchased from Africa and sold to the US.

Metals Trader
Purchasing commodities from Africa, the US, and Europe and selling to Europe, a metals trader required a receivables finance facility for a book of their receivables/customers.
 Energy Trading Group
An energy group, selling mainly into Europe, desired a receivables purchase facility to discount names, where they had increased sales and concentration.
 Clothing company
Rather than waiting 90 days until payment was made, the company wanted to pay suppliers on the day that the title to goods transferred to them, meaning it could expand its range of suppliers and receive supplier discounts.

Contents
MT799 is an essential part of international trade; a ‘free format message’ sent between banks which confirms funds or proof of deposits on a potential trade. 
MT799 allows banks to communicate between each other freely through the SWIFT system, rather than being a mechanism for transferring funds or paying.
 If you deal with
Bank Guarantees
,
Documentary Credits
, and
Letters of Credit (LCs)
, you may have heard the term ‘MT799’ being used.  A SWIFT code (also commonly referred to as SWIFTBIC) is a unique identifier which banks use to identify and send money to overseas banks.
 A SWIFT Code for a bank is identifiable by a series of letters and numbers, as shown in the diagram below:
What is the format of MT 799?
 SOURCE:
SWIFT
‘MT nnn’ stands for Message Type Number
: MT 799 messages must include a ‘Transaction Reference Number’ which can contain 16 characters in that field, and a ‘Narrative’ which provides a brief description of a transaction.  In the case of the reference number, this field must not start or end with a slash ‘/’ and must not contain two consecutive slashes ‘//’, or it will throw up the error code: T26.  With the Narrative, there are no ‘Network Validated Rules’ for MT 799.

Example of an MT 799?
 Figure 1: An example of a MT799 (Source:
SWIFT
)
An example of an MT 799 message could be as follows:
We Refer To Our MT [nnn], Date [YYMMDD],
[Input Information on the Beneficiary, Total Letter of Credit amount, Dates etc.]
 “Our Client reports funds [XXX], which have not yet been applied, please confirm the transfer status, and whether funds are available”
Thanks,
Bank [SWIFT Code]
How do I start the MT 799 process?
 Banks do not like issuing these automated messages (MT 799), as they fear being liable for the cost of the trade.  There is usually a requirement for the bank’s client to post a specific level of collateral.
 What information is required by the financial institution?
 A funder will need to know the name of the advising bank.  However, they will request more granular detail, such as the LC Number and LC Amount.  This will also include the tenor or length of the draft.  This will be alongside the latest date of
shipment
.  The company that is liable for the confirmation fee needs to be known; along with information on what products are being traded, location, port, unloading location and whether the LC is restricted for negotiation or not.
 Name of the advising bank
Letter of Credit Identifier and Total Value
Details of the Letter of Credit type (restricted, negotiable)

Types of Credit
There are several types of documentary credits, each with its own characteristics.
 Sight Credits
With sight credits,
the nominated bank (
acting on its nomination),
the confirming bank
, or
the issuing bank
effects payment upon presentation of the documents (also called “at sight”), provided documents comply with the terms and conditions of the documentary credit.
 Usance Credits
Under usance credits,
the issuing bank
undertakes to honour a compliant presentation at
a future date
(known as the “maturity date”).  There are two types of usance credits:
Acceptance credits
: A documentary credit stipulating the presentation of a bill of exchange (“draft”) which the bank will accept and pay at maturity to
the beneficiary
.
 Deferred payment credits
: Same as
acceptance credits
, except that they do not require the presentation of a draft.
 Mixed Payment Credits
Practitioners use mixed payment credits when a partial amount is payable at sight while the remainder is payable at a future date (or dates) as per the documentary credit terms.

Since these credits comprise a mix of sight and usance credits, they are known as mixed payment credits.
 Negotiation Credits
A negotiation credit is the purchase by the nominated bank of drafts (drawn on a bank other than the nominated bank) and/or documents under a complying presentation, by advancing or agreeing to advance funds to the beneficiary on or before the banking day on which reimbursement is due to the nominated bank.
 Confirmed Credits
Confirmed credits are those that also bear
the confirming bank’s
irrevocable undertaking (in addition to that of
the issuing bank)
to honour or negotiate, without recourse, documents complying with the terms and conditions of the credit.
 Transferable credits
If
the beneficiary
(i.e., the “first beneficiary”) of a documentary credit is an intermediary trader that procures the goods from another source, they may request the buyer to provide a transferable credit, which the first beneficiary can then transfer to its supplier (i.e., the “second beneficiary”). 
A transferable documentary credit must expressly state that it is transferable and provide the name of the nominated bank or the bank authorised to transfer.
 To transfer the credit,
the first beneficiary
will request that
the nominated
or
authorised bank
transfer the documentary credit to
the second beneficiary
in whole or in part.
 The first beneficiary
can request transfer to multiple
second beneficiaries,
provided the documentary credit allows for partial shipments.  However,
the second beneficiary
cannot transfer the documentary credit to another subsequent beneficiary.
 Under UCP 600, the transfer must be effected on the existing terms and conditions except for the amount, the unit price if given, the expiry date, and the latest date of shipment or period for presentation, all of which can be reduced.  Furthermore, the name of
the first beneficiary
can be substituted with
the applicant’s
.  If the documentary credit requires the presentation of an insurance document, the amount or the percentage of insurance can be increased to provide cover as initially required under the documentary credit.
 The first beneficiary
has the right to provide its invoice in substitution of
the second beneficiary’s invoice
and draw for the difference in amount, if any.  However, if it fails to provide its invoice,
the transferring bank
can forward documents received from
the second beneficiary
to
the issuing bank
.
 Back-to-back Credits
Back-to-back documentary credits serve the same purpose as transferable credits.  However, instead of transferring the original documentary credit to its supplier,
the beneficiary
requests that its bank issue a new one in favour of its supplier.  Practitioners call these back-to-back credits, as banks issue them on the back of an original documentary credit.
 A back-to-back credit is separate and independent from the original documentary credit. 
While
the issuing bank
of the back-to-back documentary credit must honour a complying presentation received under its documentary credit, the payment under the original is contingent on the ability of
the beneficiary
of the original documentary credit to provide documents in compliance with the terms and conditions.
 Instalment Credits
Instalment credits stipulate a shipment schedule with specific quantities or dates by which the goods will be shipped.
 A unique feature of these credits is that if one instalment is not shipped within the stipulated period, the entire credit is no longer available for any subsequent instalments (not just for that specific instalment).
 Revolving Credits
When buyers place repeat orders with the same sellers for the same goods at the same price and with the same terms and conditions, instead of issuing a new credit every time, they can agree with their suppliers to issue revolving credits.
 These credits are ‘revolved’ – either automatically or through a notice of reinstatement from
the issuing bank
– under the terms and conditions of the existing drawing.

The parties can agree to stipulate the number of times, the maximum amount, or the latest date up to which a revolving credit will automatically be reinstated.
 Advance Payment Credits
Typically, documentary credits provide payments to
the beneficiary
at the post-shipment stage upon presentation of documents complying with the terms and conditions.  However, it is possible to provide advance payment to
the beneficiary
at the pre-shipment stage in anticipation of
the beneficiary
presenting documents after shipping the goods.
 To accomplish this, the credit allows the beneficiary to draw for up to a specified amount by simply presenting a receipt.  The amount of any advance payment must then be deducted from invoice amounts as goods are shipped.
 Financiers can provide pre-shipment finance through two types of advance payment credits:
1.
 Red clause documentary credits
: These credits contain a clause authorising
the nominated bank
to extend an advance payment to
the beneficiary.
 The bank can release a set value at the pre-shipment stage to help
the beneficiary
procure the raw material, process, manufacture, pack, and export the goods. 
The advance payment is settled later by the submission of credit-compliant documents by the beneficiary covering the relevant shipment of goods.
 Banks historically typed this clause in red ink when credits were issued in letter form.
 2.
 Green clause documentary credits
: These credits are similar to red clause documentary credits.  However, in addition to extending advance payment to
the beneficiary
at the pre-shipment stage, green clause documentary credits also include additional coverage of pre-shipment warehousing and insurance costs.
 Standby Letters of Credit
Standby letters of credit (SBLCs) are used for a variety of purposes, such as to support an applicant’s performance obligations (performance standby), to support an applicant’s bid in a tender (bid-bond standby), to guarantee an applicant’s financial obligations to the beneficiary, which can also be a bank (financial standby), or to guarantee the performance of a commercial contract (advance payment guarantee).
 Practitioners also use SBLCs to support open account transactions where a seller ships the goods directly to the buyer, and the buyer is expected to make the payment directly to the seller. 
If the buyer fails to pay when due, the beneficiary can draw on the SBLC.

Generally, standby credits are not expected to be drawn on, hence the name.  SBLCs are akin to guarantees since, in the case of the applicant’s default or non-fulfilment of its contractual obligations, the beneficiary of an SBLC can draw under the SBLC by claiming on
the issuing bank
or
the confirming bank
as per the terms and conditions of the SBLC.
 Typically,
the beneficiary’s
claim must be supported by documents such as its statement confirming the applicant’s default, copies of unpaid invoices, or copies of transport documents as required in the SBLC.
 Although many documentary credits are often issued subject to UCP 600, UCP 600 has limited applicability to SBLCs as not all articles of UCP 600 apply to SBLCs.  The International Standby Practices of 1998 (“ISP98”) (ICC publication no 590) provides a separate and exclusive set of rules governing SBLCs issued subject to ISP98.
